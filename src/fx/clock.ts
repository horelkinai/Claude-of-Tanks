/**
 * clock.ts — shared CONTINUOUS fx clock for visual animation timelines.
 *
 * effects_combat r5: the tank visuals' self-timed animation layers (gun
 * recuperator recoil, turret-pop arc, wreck ember cooldown, staged char)
 * used to advance by the RENDER frame dt on every syncFromState call. Live
 * that is correct, but whenever the sim is halted while rAF keeps running
 * (screenshot 'shot' phase juggling, stepped-frozen critic captures) those
 * timelines aged in WALL-CLOCK time while the whole fx system stood frozen:
 * a live kill was fully charred + turret-settled before the first 0.1 s
 * capture frame, and the recuperator was back in battery by the "17 ms"
 * frame — the r4 "asset-swap at the most-watched moment" critical.
 *
 * The particle system's shared uTime is the one clock every fx element
 * already ages against, and the screenshot/critic pipeline pins/steps it
 * via fx.setFrozen(frozen, atTimeS). Visual timelines now read it through
 * this module: live play is identical (the clock advances by render dt each
 * frame), frozen captures hold every timeline, stepped captures advance them
 * exactly by the pinned step.
 *
 * fxNow() is RE-BASE IMMUNE: fx.setFrozen's age-preserving rebase (clock
 * pinned > 20 s away from its current value) shifts all fx-internal birth
 * stamps by delta; it reports the same delta here so fxNow() stays a
 * continuous monotonic timeline and visual birth anchors keep their age.
