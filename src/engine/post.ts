/**
 * post.ts — the full post-processing chain.
 *
 * Chain (extends ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1.4 / graphics-aaa.md §4 with a grade):
 *   SceneAAPass (MSAA render + resolve) → AerialPass (+ specular-AA firefly
 *   clamp) → GTAOPass → LateFxPass (copied depth) → UnrealBloomPass →
 *   OutputGradePass (ACES + sRGB + grade) → SMAAPass → FSR1
 *   (EASU + RCAS)
 *
 * The scene renders into a quality-aware multisampled HalfFloat HDR target
 * with a DepthTexture, then the aerial pass reads its resolved color directly
 * into the composer's single-sampled ping-pong buffers. This preserves real
 * geometry/foliage edge coverage while avoiding MSAA on every fullscreen post
 * pass. OutputGradePass applies the
 * renderer's exact tone mapping + output transfer and the display-space grade
 * in one draw; scope neighbor samples run through that same output transform.
 * SMAA and reconstruction still run last on the values the eye sees, so the
 * grade cannot sharpen stair steps back into an already-antialiased frame.
 * Bloom thresholds against the linear HDR buffer — sun, muzzle flash and fire
 * exceed 1.0 and bloom naturally.
 *
 * aa-r1 (owner: "glass and other vegetation is still anti aliasing a lot"):
 * SMAA is an edge-PATTERN filter — it reconstructs geometric silhouettes but
 * deliberately ignores isolated pixels, so the two loudest motion offenders
 * passed straight through it: (a) alpha-tested foliage resolves to 1px leaf/
 * blade dust that reshuffles every frame, (b) sub-pixel bright details (window
 * frames, roof-tile specular rims, far telegraph poles, glass glints) pop in
 * and out per frame. Two new stages target exactly those:
 *   - a pre-bloom FIREFLY clamp in the aerial pass (see FIREFLY_* consts):
 *     isolated HDR speculars are capped against their neighborhood so glints
 *     stop strobing and stop pulsing bloom;
 *   - a final FSR1 EASU + RCAS pass AFTER SMAA: edge-adaptive spatial
 *     reconstruction replaces bilinear enlargement, then contrast-adaptive
 *     sharpening restores fine vehicle/terrain detail without sharpening
 *     flat sky/fog. It lands at native canvas resolution; HUD/DOM never
 *     passes through the composer, so UI text keeps full sharpness.

// channels scale together, so the fire keeps its orange chroma instead of
// ACES' per-channel bleach-to-white) re-spreads the 2-20 range across
// 1.55-4.4, restoring interior gradient before ACES ever sees it. The sky
// dome self-caps at ~1.45 (sky.ts SKY_KNEE) and diffuse surfaces top out
// ~1.6, so the start only catches true emissives; asymptote 4.55 still
// tonemaps to ~0.92 so hot cores stay hot, and still crosses the 1.78 bloom
// threshold so fire/flash keep their halo.
const EM_SHOULDER_START = 1.55;

// tall), glazed roof-tile rims, gun-tube top edges, far pole tips — rasterize
// as ISOLATED 1px HDR spikes that pop in/out with every sub-pixel camera
// step. MSAA-2 averages but cannot stabilize them, SMAA ignores lone pixels
// by design, and any spike crossing BLOOM_THRESHOLD (1.78) additionally
// strobes a bloom halo. The standard temporal-AA-free answer is a
// neighborhood luminance clamp in linear HDR BEFORE bloom: pixels brighter
// than FIREFLY_MIN whose luma exceeds max(4 diagonal neighbors) x TOL + PAD
// are scaled down (hue kept) to that ceiling. Structured emissives are
// untouched by construction — fire cores, muzzle-flash bodies, tracer LINES
// and the sun disc all keep at least one hot diagonal neighbor (the sky is
// excluded by the existing depth gate anyway), so only true one-pixel
// sparkle is tamed. Runs inside the aerial pass: the neighborhood taps are
// gated behind the luma test, so ordinary pixels pay one compare.
// FIREFLY_MIN sits ABOVE the diffuse band (sunlit sand/snow reach ~1.5-1.6
// linear, per the bloom-threshold r9 note) and just below BLOOM_THRESHOLD
// (1.78): only pixels that could strobe a bloom halo pay the neighborhood
// taps, so ordinary bright fields never take the 4-tap path (measured: the
// 1.10 draft floor pulled whole sunlit meadows into the taps for ~0.45 ms;
// at 1.70 the clamp costs ~0.1 ms and sub-bloom sparkle is owned by the
// display-space dust filter below instead).
const FIREFLY_MIN = 1.70; // linear luma floor — below this, never touched
const FIREFLY_TOL = 1.30; // allowed ratio over the brightest diagonal
const FIREFLY_PAD = 0.06; // absolute headroom so dim neighborhoods don't crush

// Native-output spatial reconstruction, using FSR 1 EASU + RCAS where the
// surviving source density justifies it and hardware-linear sampling at the
// most constrained mobile floor.
// This replaces the old sequence of browser bilinear enlargement followed by
// a 9-13 tap sub-pixel blur. EASU reconstructs the governor's reduced frame
// along local edge direction; RCAS restores contrast without sharpening flat
// sky/fog or adding halos. At native resolution EASU is skipped and RCAS is a
// five-tap final pass. The DOM HUD remains outside this chain at native res.

// (the old strength stacked with canopy shadows into unmotivated black corner
// masses), saturation 1.15 → 1.08 (distance desat now comes from the aerial
// pass; global oversaturation was amplifying the foliage albedo clash),
// black anchor 0.01 → 0.006.
// r4 grade identity pass ("neutral washed tonemapping, no grade identity"):
// contrast 1.12 → 1.18 for a punchier midtone S-curve, black anchor 0.006 →
// 0.010 so shadow cores actually reach display black, vignette 0.17 → 0.23,

// shadows pulled cool blue-grey — the classic AAA warm/cool grade axis. The
// old fixed warm balance is softened (1.04 → 1.02 red) so shadows are allowed
// to actually go cool instead of being re-warmed globally.
// r5 ("grade is low-contrast with slightly lifted blacks; palette split
// between olive terrain and cyan sky"): contrast 1.18 → 1.26 (~10% more
// midtone S-curve), black anchor 0.010 → 0.016 (pull blacks down ~5% so
// shadow cores reach true display black), and a NEW green-warming term (see
// uGreenWarm below) that shifts green-dominant terrain/foliage pixels toward
// warm summer green, unifying them with the warm-key sky like WoT.
// r6 ("tonemapping/color grading is neutral and flat: midtones washed, blacks
// lifted, no filmic contrast or grade identity"): contrast 1.26 → 1.34,
// black anchor 0.016 → 0.021 (shadow cores hit true display black),
// saturation 1.08 → 1.10, vignette 0.23 → 0.27, and both split-tone poles
// pushed ~40% further apart so the warm-highlight/cool-shadow axis is an
// unmistakable grade identity rather than a subliminal one. A soft highlight
// shoulder (GRADE_KNEE*) rolls speculars/sky whites off instead of clipping
// — the barrel-top hot edge and the horizon band stop slamming to 1.0.
// r7 PIVOT FIX ("midtone contrast is low, highlights and midtones compress
// into the same band; foreground reads underexposed"): the contrast op was a
// linear expansion around DISPLAY 0.5 — but pixel-measuring the frozen shots
// put the entire lit playfield at 0.20-0.30 display luma, i.e. the whole
// scene sat BELOW the pivot, so "more contrast" only dragged every midtone
// darker (lit grass 0.21, hull flank 0.09) while the hazy hills/sky (0.45+)
// stretched brighter — the exact "dark flat foreground under a bright far
// field" split the critic flagged. The pivot now sits at 0.33, inside the
// scene's actual midtone band: contrast separates lit-vs-shadow around the
// playfield instead of crushing all of it, and the light-rig lift
// (lighting.ts hemi bounce floor + renderer exposure 1.08 → 1.16) moves the
// lit field up toward the WoT ~0.35 reference. Black anchor eases 0.021 →
// 0.012 (the anchor no longer needs to fake density the pivot now provides).
// Greens: measured lit grass rgb was (0.25,0.21,0.04) — blue channel ~zero,
// the "lime-yellow drift" — because GREEN_WARM 0.90-blue x high-tint
// 0.925-blue x balance 0.975-blue compounded to a 0.81 blue kill on every
// green-dominant highlight. GREEN_WARM softened to a hue nudge, a dedicated
// ~9% green desaturation term (uGreenDesat) pulls foliage chroma back to the
// WoT olive band, and global saturation eases 1.10 → 1.06.
// r6 grade-identity push ("tonemapping/color grading is neutral and flat —
// AAA tank games ship a strong LUT: warm highlights, cooled shadows, punchy
// contrast, subtle vignette"): contrast 1.30 → 1.36 around the same measured
// 0.33 pivot, saturation 1.06 → 1.09, vignette 0.24 → 0.26, and the split-
// tone poles pushed ~20% further apart (below). Paired with renderer.ts
// exposure 1.16 → 1.20 so the midtone band holds its WoT-reference level
// while lit-vs-shadow separation deepens (contrast alone would drag the
// sub-pivot playfield darker — the r7 failure mode).
// r5 ("verdant gameplay cameras are oversaturated acid green-yellow — neon
// mobile-game; real WoT ground is desaturated multi-hue"): global saturation
// 1.09 → 1.045 (~-4% overall, and the aerial chroma octave now supplies hue
// VARIETY so the field no longer needs raw chroma to read alive), green
// chroma pull 0.12 → 0.19, and the green-warm hue nudge halved (below) so

  // DIFFERENT world point (~10-20 px/frame of slide) — the blend both
  // smeared and failed to settle the boil. This is the exact problem
  // three's WebGPU GTAONode solves with temporalFiltering+TRAA and the GTAO
  // paper solves with temporal reprojection, so do the same here in WebGL:
  //  - REPROJECT: reconstruct each AO texel's world point from the CURRENT
  //    scene depth + inverse view-projection, project it through LAST
  //    frame's view-projection, and sample the history there. The boil
  //    sources (trees/terrain/props) are world-static, so camera-only
  //    reprojection is exact for them — no motion vectors needed.
  //  - REJECT: store current device depth in the otherwise-unused history
  //    alpha channel. A reprojected sample is accepted only when that stored
  //    depth matches the depth predicted by the current world point. This is
  //    the missing disocclusion test around overlapping trunks, leaves,
  //    buildings and vehicles; it costs no extra render target or texture.
  //  - RECTIFY: clamp the reprojected history to the min/max of the current
  //    frame's 5-tap AO neighborhood (standard TAA neighborhood clamping),
  //    then cap brighter history close to the live sample. The neighborhood
  //    alone can contain both sides of a high-contrast contact edge and admit
  //    an almost-white history sample over newly dark AO.
  //  - ACCUMULATE: k=0.15 toward the current frame (~85% history). Isolated
  //    identical matrices retain that weight: switching the first repeated
  //    frame to k=1 made 60 Hz camera motion on 120 Hz output alternate between
  //    retained history and current AO. Four consecutive identical matrices
  //    retire history so a genuinely stopped view becomes byte-stable.
  //  - RELEASE: history may suppress a one-frame dark occlusion spike, but it
  //    may never keep a newly exposed surface darker than the current AO.
  //    Bright history is bounded as well, so foliage/card edges settle without
  //    flashing pale on motion frames. Stale dark contact patches still clear
  //    in one frame rather than trailing the camera through overlapping tree
  //    and structure silhouettes.
  // Off-screen reprojections and the first frame after a >250 ms gap (map
  // switch, AO re-enable, resize) take the current frame verbatim.
  // Integration: GTAOPass.OUTPUT.Off runs G-buffer + AO + denoise and skips

  // reprojects pdRenderTarget into a ping-pong history, then reproduces the
  // two-step Default composition (copy + multiply-blend) fed by the history.

  // PERFORMANCE.md adaptive-quality contract: the preset ladder is static, so
  // hardware weaker than the reference machine rides p5 dips with no
  // recovery. Standard AAA answer: scale the internal render resolution to
  // hold frame time. The governor tracks a ~1 s EMA of the render delta and
  // steps `dynScale` (multiplied into the composer pixel ratio below) between
  // 1.0 and DYN_MIN while the frame budget is blown, stepping back up once
  // there is clear headroom.
  //
  // engine-aa r1 ROOT CAUSE (owner: "the ui in garage and in battle is still
  // this weird pixelly thing"): the r5 governor compared the EMA of the rAF
  // DELTA against two ABSOLUTE thresholds — down past 18.5 ms, up below
  // 13.5 ms. Under vsync the up threshold is UNREACHABLE on a 60 Hz display:
  // rAF deltas are quantized to >= 16.7 ms no matter how much GPU headroom
  // exists, so the "hysteresis dead band" was a ONE-WAY RATCHET. Any ~3 s of
  // sustained load (boot shader compiles outliving the warmup, an agent
  // build, a background app) stepped the scale down, and nothing could ever
  // step it back up. Reproduced with tools/tmp-engine-aa-probe.mjs (dpr 2,
  // vsync-locked): a 12 s load spike drove dynScale to the 0.67 floor —
  // composer at ~1.0x CSS on a dpr-2 display, i.e. HALF the physical pixels
  // per axis, double-upscaled — and 30+ s of idle at EMA 16.7 ms never
  // recovered one step. That floor state is exactly the soft/chunky garage
  // and battle in the owner's screen recording (DOM HUD crisp, 3D mush).
  // The rebuild keeps the stepped/rate-limited/retina-fenced shape and fixes
  // the decision logic:
  //  - BUDGET-RELATIVE thresholds: the frame budget is the best stable
  //    display cadence observed this session, bounded by the canonical
  //    presentation cap and the existing 34 ms slow-display ceiling. Short
  //    catch-up intervals on a fast panel cannot demand a rate above the
  //    scheduler's deliberate cap. Keeping the best cadence prevents a live
  //    battle slowdown from redefining 12-30 fps as the new healthy target.
  //  - MISS-RATIO evidence: a step needs the EMA level AND the share of
  //    frames blowing budget x 1.35 to agree (down needs > 15% missed, up
  //    needs < 4%), so scheduler jitter alone cannot thrash the scale.
  //  - QUALITY-AWARE FLOOR: default High keeps >= 90% of its preset
  //    resolution per axis (effective ratio 1.35 on the 1.5 cap); explicit
  //    Ultra may fall only to the complete High ceiling. Mobile presets retain
  //    lower explicit floors because avoiding a tab OOM is the harder limit.
  //  - ANTI-FLAP BACKOFF instead of a dead band: an up-step punished by a
  //    down-step within 8 s doubles the wait before the next up try
  //    (1.5 → 3 → 6 → 12 → 20 s cap; a flap-free minute resets it). Recovery
  //    from a genuine load drop stays 1 step per 1.5 s — floor to 1.0 in
  //    ~4.5 s.
  //  - hidden-document frames never govern: main.ts's rAF-starvation
  //    fallback ticks at ~10 Hz by design — that cadence says nothing about
  //    GPU cost and used to read as a permanent budget blowout.
  //  - DPR-1 FENCE: native-density desktop output never falls below 1.0. AO
  //    relief and the preset tier handle pressure there; a supposedly adaptive
  //    system must not trade the whole picture for sub-native blur.
  //  - STEPPED + RATE-LIMITED, not a per-frame lerp: every ratio change
  //    reallocates the whole composer chain (scene HDR target, GTAO, bloom,
  //    SMAA); steps of ~0.09 at most once per 1.5 s.
  //  - HUD/DOM stays native-crisp: only the composer's internal buffers
  //    scale; the final pass upscales (linear-filtered buffers) to the
  //    untouched canvas.
  // Telemetry: dataset.dynScale / dataset.dynBudgetMs / dataset.frameEmaMs
  // on the canvas (1 Hz), plus the read-only post.dynScale getter below —
