# How Claude of Tanks works

This document describes the current game runtime. Historical fleet work and
quarantined reference assets are outside its scope. A Vite application runs a
Three.js rendering stack around a deterministic 60 Hz armored-combat
simulation. Multiplayer transports the same authority model over WebRTC or
WebSocket without moving gameplay decisions into the renderer.

## Runtime at a glance

```text
controls ──► 60 Hz authority ──► state + reliable events ──► presentation bridge
                 │                                          │
                 ├─ movement / terrain / collision           ├─ first-party tank visuals
                 ├─ aim / ballistics / armor / modules       ├─ tracks / suspension / effects
                 ├─ spotting / concealment / bots            ├─ HUD / audio / killcam
                 └─ destructibles / result                    └─ Three.js renderer / post
```

Solo composes the authority directly in the browser. LAN and private rooms put
one trusted browser in charge and carry inputs/state over WebRTC. Ranked puts
the authority in the dedicated Node service and uses an authenticated,
reconnectable WebSocket. All modes share the same movement, armor, damage,
spotting, bot, destructible, and outcome rules.

## Boot, garage, and lazy work

`src/main.ts` owns application composition. The first visible garage frame is
kept deliberately narrow: renderer, garage, selected vehicle, and essential UI
arrive first. `fleetFactory.ts` maps each tank id to an import-free ownership
manifest and downloads only that profile family before its first real build.
The battlefield constructor is a separate dynamic module; terrain, vegetation,
structures, and wreck code do not enter the startup graph. During a map build,
each deterministically selected tank wreck yields once so its exact vehicle
family can load before baking resumes. Studio and deterministic screenshot
authoring are the only explicit full-fleet gates. Garage and battle transitions
remain painted while this asynchronous work proceeds, so low-end hardware sees
progress instead of a blocked black canvas.

The workshop around the selected vehicle is a separate, demand-loaded scene.
Ten identities are bound to ten battlefield themes and selected from
the Staging Area control beside Home and Record. The environment choice is
persisted independently from the next-battle map. Verdant Motor Pool keeps its
original enclosed workshop shell, corrugated walls, high-bay fixtures, service
signage, floor equipment, cables, cones, barrels, and authored industrial
lighting. The restored stage is the sole Verdant owner; it does not allocate an
outdoor terrain pack. After the Garage becomes interactive and quiet, one
shared four-bay service layer streams in across all ten locations: a Burlak
gantry, Abrams welding bay, T-90M armor station, and rolled K2 teardown occupy
all four quadrants. Each environment shifts the complete layer slightly around
its landmark; only Verdant shows the wall-mounted interior props that require
its enclosed shell. These are full-detail fleet shapes but not player-owned
vehicles: the worker applies three shared solid national service finishes
(Russian green, American desert tan, and Korean olive), allocates no camouflage
or surface-map canvases, and does not transfer colour/UV/tangent attributes that
the map-free materials cannot read. Signature paint remains exclusive to the
selected hero and playable fleet.

The other nine choices build compact Garage-only interpretations of their maps.
They use the battle renderer's real procedural dome, cloud layers, fog, and
map-specific sun preset; a lightweight sky registry keeps this independent of
full battlefield loading. Their opening view includes stocked, connected
maintenance frames before the wider 360-degree service district.
A 41×37 terrain grid stays flat across the shared service terrace, then carries
deterministic relief at the perimeter. Rocks and trees are instanced. Each theme
adds seven connected structures plus maintenance bays on both sides of the hero,
flood towers, stocked track/wheel racks, tool carts, drums, and crates. Cinder Junction
is a rail overhaul station with three complete roads, sleepers, platforms,
canopies, and a nine-bay roundhouse. Tank-shaped low-detail scene-pack proxies
are forbidden. Instead, one idle-streamed full-detail fleet workshop is shared
by every Garage: Burlak and Abrams service vehicles, a T-90M turret/gun and
Relikt rack, plus a supported K2 hull, road wheels, track shoes, skirts, and
weapon-service hardware. These scenes do not load battle terrain, collision,
destructibles, services, or animated vegetation.
Each service island is assembled on one terrain-seated local frame. Exact
endpoint braces, footings beneath every column, supported roof purlins, crane
runways and trolleys, powered winches, pipe manifolds, safety rails, service
pits, benches, and stocked pallets make the machinery physically readable from
all four Garage quadrants. The nine outdoor packs share only the implementation
vocabulary: their signature facility remains map-specific (desert shade depot,
heated winter bay, arsenal magazine, drydock crane, rail roundhouse, monsoon
drainage shelter, alpine tunnel portal, recovery gantry, or foundry line).
Any world retained for the next round stays detached and dormant. The archive
monitor keeps only
its current and incoming images resident and stops scheduling work while its
Garage roots are detached for battle.

The selected hero uses authored running gear as its Garage support surface.
Decorative tow hooks, mud flaps, and other underside attachments may hang below
that datum, but the track run is placed exactly on the turntable. Gallery and
battle code retain the conservative all-geometry floor measurement where
penetration avoidance matters more than presentation contact.

Viewport synchronization also has one typed engine owner. Renderer output,
camera projection, post targets, and shadow frustums resize together. If an
embedded or mobile browser initially reports a 0x0 layout, a bounded temporary
observer repairs the first positive layout automatically and then removes all
of its recovery work.

Battle hover/focus is a typed intent boundary rather than a collection of UI
callbacks. It transfers battle-only modules, plans only the next deterministic
roster, coalesces that roster's texture bakes, and reserves one concrete map
when the garage shows Random. The click consumes that same map instead of
rolling again. Covered loading safely drains a partial hover bake before
repainting map camouflage, then resumes the exact work with a faster frame
budget behind the opaque loading screen. Tank/map changes and new rounds
cancel stale intent.

The quality system combines capability checks with a boot-time render probe.
Resolution, shadows, post effects, texture sizes, vegetation density, and
background work scale independently. A WebGL target watchdog can disable a
failing feature and restore output without changing combat behavior.

The battle HUD upgrades its immediately available tactical cartography with a
small baked WebP for the active map. A typed minimap lifecycle coalesces repeat
requests and rechecks both active-world identity and prepared world services
after decode. A late result from a previous map is discarded; an active-map
load error keeps the existing full-resolution procedural fallback.

Combat effects have a separate typed lifecycle. Battle intent may transfer the
effects module while the garage remains interactive, but scene objects are not
created until Battle, Studio, or deterministic capture entry. Concurrent
consumers share one initializer. A failed chunk transfer or WebGL allocation
clears only its own in-flight receipt, allowing the next entry attempt to
recover without reloading the page.

Killcam acquisition follows the same separation without sharing the effects
owner. Garage and render-loop callers see one stable inactive facade until
entry completes; the fixed-step solo simulation then receives the direct live
capture runtime. Chunk and initializer failures remain independently retryable,
so a lost replay download cannot permanently wedge a later match or capture.

Player actions also cross one typed policy owner. It holds the active shell
cards and consumable cooldowns, applies repairs and special actions only for
local authority, and forwards the equivalent commands during network battles.
Because simulation rules are injected after Battle intent, this consolidation
does not pull combat code or rendering work back into first-visit garage boot.

The variable-rate frame loop delegates device sampling to a second typed
owner. It reuses scratch records while combining keyboard, touch, gamepad,
pointer-lock fallback, zoom, free-look, and sniper state into the existing
tank and camera input records. Pauses, loading veils, killcams, empty magazines,
and destroyed players are handled before either authority path sees input.

The browser clock is also isolated from that frame body. One typed scheduler
coalesces animation-frame requests, explicitly rearms after WebGL restoration,
and rescues controls in embedded panes that remain interactive while reporting
themselves hidden. Recovery is focus- and cadence-gated, so background tabs
stay frozen and a returning animation frame cannot create a second loop.

Rendered tanks cross a separate typed presentation owner. Solo state is
interpolated between completed 60 Hz steps; multiplayer state is already
interpolated and locally corrected by its bridge, so it is presented directly
instead of being smoothed twice. The owner also removes fully hidden opponents
from traversal, reduces off-screen running-gear detail work, and keeps dust and
exhaust density fixed across 60, 120, and 240 Hz displays.

## First-party vehicle pipeline

The registry currently retains **156 vehicle records**. The production
projection exposes **117**; an explicit local-development key unlocks all
**154 first-party playable models** with `DEV` labels, while two generic
reference placeholders remain report-only. The generated inventory is
maintained in `VEHICLE-ROSTER.md`.
Playable geometry is assembled at runtime from authored profile stations,
armor forms, fittings, and procedural running gear in
`src/vehicles/factoryGeometry.ts`, `src/vehicles/tankFactoryCore.ts`,
`src/vehicles/fleetFactory.ts`, and
`src/vehicles/profiles/`. Node audits retain the eager `tankFactory.ts` facade;
the browser runtime uses the demand-loaded facade. The public runtime
does not swap those vehicles for community GLBs. Historical source assets are
quarantined comparison material and are stripped from public builds.

Each vehicle spec supplies dimensions, mass, mobility, gun limits, ammunition,
armor plates, modules, crew, concealment, and render metadata. Texture programs
paint the selected camouflage, surface breakup, welds, wear, and roughness. The
same spec drives the garage card, icon set, loading roster, armor logic, bot
selection, and final visual, which prevents the UI and simulation from quietly
describing different tanks.

Tracks are not a rigid decoration. The movement state samples terrain support,
solves hull pitch/roll with suspension damping, and passes wheel/track contact
to the visual. Links follow the running-gear path, conform over terrain-facing
road wheels, and scroll from measured hull travel rather than a cosmetic timer.

## World and renderer

Twenty authored battlefields are generated from code. The original eight are
Verdant Fields, Sirocco Wadi, Frosthollow, Steinburg, Saltmere Bay, Amberford,
Tarkhan Steppe, and Cinder Junction; Frontier Basin, Nordhavn Fjord, Jade River
Delta, Redrock Divide, Monsoon Ridge, Glacier Pass, Obsidian Caldera, and
Ironworks form the second set; Ruinspires, Blackglass District, Titan Gorge,
and Skybridge Chasm complete the current roster. Each owns a height field, material palette,
roads, foliage, structures, collision, concealment, destructibles, lighting,
sky, and minimap. Shared structure, wreck, loose-prop, utility-network,
terrain-attachment, and destruction systems keep the expanded vocabulary
consistent, while map-specific composition preserves distinct tactical spaces.
The browser and dedicated server share generated collision manifests so an
obstacle is not passable on one authority and solid on another.

Buildings use two bounded authoring paths. Large landmarks add windows,
reveals, ledges, gutters, downpipes, attached service equipment, roof fittings,
facade bay piers, framed utility apertures, louvers, and biome-specific trim to
the existing material buckets before those buckets are merged. Large side-wall
windows use recessed surrounds and crossed mullions instead of flat dark slabs.
Lightweight destructible structures use intact and broken
`InstancedMesh` pools, so adding façade depth or a persistent collapsed frame
does not add one draw call per building. A bounded deterministic
`instanceColor` multiplier gives repeated wood, canvas, and metal structures
individual weathering tones; the packed debris slot inherits the same tint
when that exact building is destroyed. An authoring-time support graph rejects
floating fixtures and disconnected landmark parts. The same support receipt is
created before each lightweight building is merged, proving every intact roof,
porch, ladder, rack, frame, utility fitting, and grounded accessory reaches a
wall or physical ground contact. Collision is then captured from the final
seeded worlds into the dedicated-server manifest.

Wall, roof, stone, wood, straw, canvas, and structural-metal materials use
color, normal, and a packed linear surface texture (red AO, green roughness).
Sourced CC0 PBR sets replace the procedural fallback in-place after loading;
both paths keep the same material bindings. Glass uses the existing environment
map and restrained clearcoat, while a deterministic minority of window panes
emit warm light into the renderer's existing bloom path. Tone mapping, bloom,
environment reflections, warm sun, cool sky fill, and cascaded shadows remain
central renderer responsibilities rather than per-building effects. The world
uses PMREM environment response instead of a full-screen SSR pass: at combat
distance it preserves the intended glass read without adding another
resolution-dependent reflection traversal to every frame.

The rendering system uses Three.js: a WebGL renderer, procedural sky and PMREM,
cascaded shadows, atmospheric fog, post-processing, particles, decals, and
audio. It does not decide whether a shell penetrated or a vehicle was spotted.
It presents state emitted by the authority.

## Movement and aiming

Movement advances in fixed 1/60-second steps. Engine force, gearing, steering,
braking, slope response, ground type, map bounds, tank collision, crushable
props, suspension, and hull attitude are resolved independently of render
rate. A clamped frame accumulator prevents a stalled/backgrounded tab from
integrating a giant physics step when it resumes.

The center screen aim ray establishes the requested world point. Turret yaw and
gun pitch track that point one-to-one within the vehicle's real traverse,
elevation, depression, and rotation-rate limits. The gun marker shows the
actual bore solution while the center marker preserves the requested point;
obstruction and convergence remain visible rather than silently moving the
shot. Dispersion, movement bloom, travel time, drop, and penetration are then
resolved from the real muzzle transform.

## Combat authority

The combat path is data-first and renderer-free:

1. The gun validates reload, ammunition, damage state, and physical aim limits.
2. Ballistics advances the selected AP, APCR, HEAT, HE, or APFSDS shell through
   time with muzzle velocity, gravity, and distance behavior.
3. Collision identifies the struck plate or destructible.
4. Armor resolves impact angle, normalization, ricochet, caliber overmatch,
   spaced armor, composites, ERA, and penetration roll.
5. Damage resolves HP, crew, modules, tracks, fuel, fire, ammo rack, and repair
   state.
6. The authority emits durable state plus reliable one-shot events for visuals,
   audio, the shot log, killcam, and results report.

Spotting uses view range, concealment, movement/firing bloom, foliage, and the
15 m bush rule. Viewer-specific network snapshots omit hidden enemy positions;
clients do not receive coordinates for vehicles they are not permitted to see.

## Bots

Bots use the same controls, movement limits, spotting, ammunition, armor, and
damage paths as players. Their seeded openings vary by match, traversability
planning reads the battlefield, local steering negotiates traffic/obstacles,
and recovery logic backs out of stalls and replans. The seed keeps test runs
reproducible without making every public battle follow one memorized route.

## Multiplayer transport and prediction

Protocol v4 carries validated envelopes with sequence, acknowledgement, and
simulation ticks. A client submits throttle, steering, brake, shell choice,
fire, explicit consumable action bits, and a bounded yaw/pitch/distance aim
intent. Keeping distance preserves the same finite center-screen world point
used by solo play; the former infinite-ray approximation changed close-range
gun parallax and could lay multiplayer barrels high. The authority still owns
traverse, elevation/depression, muzzle position, dispersion, hits, damage,
spotting, and victory.

LAN/private WebRTC splits traffic:

- reliable ordered control: handshake, lobby/room state, combat events, ping,
  errors, and leave;
- unordered zero-retransmit state: replaceable live input and 20 Hz snapshots.

Snapshots use compact encoding, acknowledgements, deltas, and periodic
keyframes. Remote tanks use adaptive buffered interpolation with bounded
extrapolation. The local tank predicts the shared movement code and replays
unacknowledged input after authority corrections. Persistent facts—match
result and destructible revision/state—also exist in snapshots/keyframes, while
reliable events carry one-shot presentation work exactly once.

## Persistent room and rematch lifecycle

A private or LAN room outlives one battle:

```text
waiting ──everyone ready──► starting ──load──► playing
   ▲                                              │
   └──────── result + readiness reset ◄───────────┘
```

Protocol-v5 `ROOM_COMMAND` and `ROOM_STATE` messages carry the room's round,
last result, roster, team, vehicle, equipment, map, and ready state on the
reliable channel. After a result the same peers remain connected, the room
returns to waiting, readiness resets, and the next round replaces only the
simulation authority—not the WebRTC transport. The report shows live
play-again intent. Closing it returns to the garage without leaving; a compact
room strip stays under Battle. Readiness locks vehicle/equipment/team changes
until the player unreadies. Explicit Leave disconnects from the room.

Invite URLs carry the validated six-character room code and a normalized host
callsign for human presentation. From the first loading frame the recipient
sees “Join Name’s Game”; after signaling joins, the service-provided host
identity replaces the URL hint. Room-code-only legacy links remain valid. On
the same deployed origin, opening the link loads the game and joins after the
normal boot gate.
Joined browsers keep that canonical room URL and a stable browser identity.
Reloading while the host's persistent room is waiting creates a fresh WebRTC
channel, reattaches the same player identity, and restores the room state;
vehicle and equipment can then be selected before readying again. An explicit
Leave clears the room URL. Because private/LAN authority lives in the host's
browser, reloading the host itself still ends that browser-owned authority;
host-failover would require migrating authority to another peer or service.
LAN uses direct Wi-Fi WebRTC and automatic same-origin/local signaling; private
internet rooms use deployed signaling plus configured ICE/TURN fallback.

## Results, replay, and presentation events

The end report is combat-focused because the game has no currency, XP grind,
or tech tree. It summarizes outcome, survival, damage, kills, assists, blocked
damage, spotting contribution, shot efficiency, team roster, and rematch
readiness. Killcam and shot panels are projections of resolved combat events,
not a second damage calculation.

Heavy cosmetic bursts are admitted through a bounded presentation queue so
several remote destructions cannot monopolize one render frame. Critical state
events apply immediately; smoke, debris, and other expensive effects can be
staged over subsequent frames without changing the outcome.

## Scene Studio and the 88-frame field archive

Scene Studio (`src/game/studio.ts`) runs a live battlefield with combat AI
paused. It can place any current vehicle, conform it to terrain, pose turret and
gun within spec limits, apply camouflage/damage states, fire the game's real
effects, freeze deterministic time, and capture through the full renderer up
to the GPU's safe output size.

The landing page, public field manual, Gallery, and Studio use a reproducible
visual archive rather than hand-retouched art. It leads with 13 owner-selected
features, then preserves 30 action frames, 30 foreground-led frames, five
directed Studio keyframes, and ten deterministic game/interface captures. Six
contact sheets expose all 60 campaign frames in the collection-review pass. The
generated manifest records map, feature, actors, effects, provenance, grading,
and review-sheet membership for every public frame:

```bash
npm run shots:battle:generate
npm run shots:battle:grade -- --root shots/marketing-battles-r3
npm run studio:action:render
npm run showcase:publish
npm run showcase:check
```

## Verification

The repository keeps simulation checks in Node, transport/service checks in
Node and real browsers, render/capture checks in Chromium, and public/private
build checks in Vite.

```bash
npm test
npm run test:net:browser
npm run tank:native:check
npm run build
npm run build:private
```
