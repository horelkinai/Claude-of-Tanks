# Screenshot Contract

The critic pipeline sees the game ONLY through `node tools/screenshot.mjs`. The game
MUST uphold this contract at all times or the build is considered broken.

## Required globals (set by the game in `src/main.ts` or an imported module)

- `window.__GAME_READY` — set to `true` only after the full scene is loaded and the
  first frame with final lighting/post-processing has rendered.
- `window.__SHOTS` — object with:
  - `views: string[]` — list of deterministic camera/scenario presets.
  - `set(name: string)` — synchronously (or within ~1s) configure the scene for that
    view: position the camera, spawn/trigger any required state (e.g. an explosion),
    freeze randomness so repeated captures look comparable.

## Required views (minimum set — add more freely, never remove)

| view | what it must show |
|---|---|
| `battlefield` | wide establishing shot of the map: terrain, sky, foliage, several tanks |
| `player_view` | standard WoT third-person chase camera behind the player tank, HUD visible |
| `spectator_view` | allied chase camera with the death-state vehicle switcher visible |
| `sniper_view` | first-person gunner zoom with reticle, penetration indicator, HUD |
| `tank_closeup_modern` | close orbit shot of the M1A2 Abrams model, full detail |
| `tank_closeup_ww2` | close orbit shot of the Tiger I (or T-34-85) model, full detail |
| `tank_closeup_t90m` | close orbit shot of the T-90M model, full detail |
| `tank_closeup_leo2a7` | close orbit shot of the Leopard 2A7 model, full detail |
| `combat_firing` | a tank mid-shot: muzzle flash, smoke, tracer visible |
| `explosion` | a vehicle destruction: fireball, debris, smoke column |
| `garage` | the garage/tank-select screen |
| `battlefield_desert` | wide establishing shot of the desert map (dunes, mesas, adobe village, palms) |
| `battlefield_winter` | wide establishing shot of the winter map (snow, frozen lake, birches, overcast) |
| `battlefield_urban` | wide establishing shot of the town map (street grid, rowhouses, rubble) |

## Rules

- No view may depend on user input or wall-clock time; `set(name)` must fully
  determine what is captured ~1.2s later.
- Zero console errors during load and capture. The harness exits non-zero on any.
- Run `node tools/screenshot.mjs` after every change that could affect rendering;
  shots land in `shots/<view>.png` at 1920x1080.

## Public showcase archive

The public image system is a larger, reproducible layer above the minimum critic
views. `tools/marketing-shots/scenes-action-r3/` and
`scenes-foreground-r3/` contain 60 approved multi-tank campaign compositions.
The archive leads with 13 owner picks and also preserves five directed Studio
keyframes and ten deterministic interface/system frames.

Visual review is required. The publisher tiles the action and foreground
campaigns into six ordered contact sheets, ten captures per sheet, so the entire
set can be checked for camera intersections, weak silhouettes, repetitive
staging, and effects that erase vehicle readability before individual 4K frames
are admitted.

```bash
npm run shots:battle:generate
npm run shots:battle:grade -- --root shots/marketing-battles-r3
npm run studio:action:render
npm run showcase:publish
npm run showcase:check
```

`public/media/showcase-r1/manifest.json` must report 13 owner picks, 30 action
frames, 30 foreground frames, five Studio frames, ten interface frames, 88 total
frames, six process sheets, and `firstPartyRuntimeOnly: true`. Landing, docs,
Gallery, and Studio consume that manifest through the shared media archive
component. Raw 4K PNGs remain local capture evidence; compressed WebP frames,
review sheets, and the manifest are shipped artifacts.

### Open Graph branding

`npm run og:images` regenerates the default game card and all 17 route/private-room
cards at 1200×630. Each uses the current `public/brand/logo-mark.svg` at its native
square aspect ratio, with the bottom-left ABC Monument Grotesk lockup: white
CLAUDE, amber OF TANKS. Do not substitute the compact all-white website lockup
or a precomposed raster logo. The default retains the owner-selected T-90 column
photo; route companions retain their own photography and page labels.

Preview three representatives with `npm run og:images -- --only=game,home,docs-models`,
then regenerate the full set and run `node tools/marketing-shots/og-images.selftest.mjs`
and `npm run test:seo`. Existing canonical image URLs stay unchanged.

### Current UI evidence

The R1 archive remains the source of truth for action, hero, vehicle, and
multiplayer photography. Current interface evidence is refreshed separately
through the 22-frame R2 UI collection, with explicit non-Abrams vehicle IDs for
Garage, Gallery, HUD, sight, and killcam captures. The R2 spectator frame stays
in the evidence archive, while public multiplayer presentation uses the original
dual-client capture.

```bash
npm run shots:r2:capture
npm run shots:r2:grade
npm run shots:r2:publish
npm run shots:r2:check
```

`public/media/showcase-r2/manifest.json` must report 10 Garage frames, six
other interface frames, six live-interface frames, 22 total frames, and three
review sheets. This collection supplements—never replaces—the R1 action
library.

## Public feature loops

The six short feature loops are deterministic Scene Studio captures based on
approved action-campaign sightlines. Capture masters remain local. The publisher
creates a VP9 WebM, a JPEG poster, and a byte receipt for every loop. GIF
duplicates are prohibited because they reproduce the same frames at several
times the transfer and repository cost.

```bash
npm run studio:features:render
npm run studio:features:publish
node tools/marketing-shots/feature-loops.selftest.mjs
```

`public/media/feature-loops-r1/manifest.json` must report six passed loops and
zero failures. Each loop must include two or more identified vehicles, one of the
approved map families, a six-second duration, and matching file-size receipts.
Public pages use WebM for playback and JPEG posters for static or no-script
presentation.
