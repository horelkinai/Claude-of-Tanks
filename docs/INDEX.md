# Documentation index

This is the navigation hub for Claude of Tanks documentation. It prioritizes
current product contracts, contributor guidance, reproducible source evidence,
and durable architecture decisions.

If two current documents disagree, SYSTEMS.md owns runtime architecture,
MULTIPLAYER-ARCHITECTURE.md owns network behavior, and BUILD-STANDARD.md plus
GEOMETRY-GATE.md own vehicle-authoring acceptance.

## Start here

| Document | Audience | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ../README.md | Everyone | Public overview, screenshots, features, architecture, and quick start |
| TECHNICAL-OVERVIEW.md | Engineers and technical reviewers | Current architecture, authority boundaries, runtime lifecycle, source ownership, and verification model |
| FEATURES.md | Players, reviewers, contributors | Visible features connected to their implementation and verification |
| HOW-IT-WORKS.md | Technical readers | Technical description of the current game from boot to results |
| GAME-MODES.md | Players and engineers | Standard, flag, zone, Turbo Ball, and Horde rules, authority, presentation, and tests |
| GARAGE-ENVIRONMENTS.md | Players, designers, and engineers | Ten Garage locations, visual contract, scene-pack lifecycle, collision, performance, and quality gates |
| SYSTEMS.md | Engineers | Current subsystem ownership, data flow, lifecycle, and invariants |
| DEVELOPMENT.md | Engineers and release owners | Local setup, services, test matrix, tools, and release procedure |
| [tank-generation/README.md](tank-generation/README.md) | Tank builders and takeover agents | Source/markup intake, geometry methods, prompts, strict gates, case studies and handoff templates |
| DECISIONS.md | Contributors | Current architecture decisions, non-goals, and proof requirements |

The public browser field manual is available at
https://cot.kevinliu.studio/docs and is sourced from ../docs.html.

The current public presentation is image-led and sourced from a reproducible
88-frame archive: 13 owner-selected features, 60 approved 4K campaign frames,
five directed Studio keyframes, and ten deterministic interface captures. The
manifest lives at `../public/media/showcase-r1/manifest.json`; the landing page,
field manual, Tank Gallery, and Scene Studio share its filtering and inspection
component. Six published campaign contact sheets preserve the human
visual-review pass; the owner-approved ten-Garage contact sheet documents the
complete current environment set.

## Vehicle-authoring law

These documents are current for changes to playable tank geometry and generated
assets:

| Document | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [tank-generation/README.md](tank-generation/README.md) | Current end-to-end creation workflow and chronology of source-study requirements; reusable prompts and run/handoff templates |
| BUILD-STANDARD.md | Vehicle construction, silhouette, topology, fittings, tracks, parenting, review, and landing law |
| GEOMETRY-GATE.md | Measured geometry acceptance, scoring, caps, and anti-gaming rules |
| TANK-ASSET-PIPELINE.md | Presentation asset and fingerprint release contract |
| DECORATIONS.md | Vehicle fitting and decoration system |
| references/tanks/ | Per-vehicle source packets, measurements, known limitations, and certification history |
| geometry-gate/ | Tool-written work orders and score ledger |
| FLEET-FREEZE-CURRENT.json | Deterministic geometry fingerprint ledger |

## World, simulation, and game research

The files under research/ preserve the source study used to build individual
systems:

- armor-penetration.md
- shells-ballistics.md
- movement-physics.md
- modern-roster.md
- tank-roster.md
- graphics-aaa.md

Research explains inputs and trade-offs. Shipped behavior is defined by code
and the current subsystem documents above.

## Engineering history

Only history that explains a current invariant or a major incident remains in
the repository. Reusable tank-generation prompts, handoff templates and curated
case studies live in [tank-generation/](tank-generation/README.md). Transient
execution handoffs, raw machine-specific benchmarks and redundant transcript
dumps stay outside the maintained documentation; current per-tank/batch packets
retain decisions, status and reproducible evidence summaries.

| Document or directory | Historical role |
| --- | --- |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | Original locked nine-module implementation plan |
| DESIGN.md | Tank-generation program architecture |
| LESSONS.md | Incidents that informed vehicle build law |
| POSTMORTEM-RUNNING-GEAR-REGRESSION-2026-08-13.md | Running-gear incident record |
| DECISIONS.md | Maintained implementation choices and migration constraints |

Historical counts and architecture claims may differ from the current runtime.

## Documentation maintenance

When behavior changes:

1. Update the nearest current subsystem document.
2. Update README.md or FEATURES.md if the visible product changed.
3. Update docs.html if the public technical reference changed, and GALLERY.md
   when the Tank Gallery contract changed.
4. Update the source-level module comment when ownership or invariants changed.
5. Record only a durable, still-binding architecture choice in `DECISIONS.md`;
   keep migration narration and raw run output in Git history, `.qa-*`, or
   external artifacts.
6. Verify every relative link and referenced path.

Machine-generated audits, performance trends, traces, screenshots, and critic
rounds belong under ignored `.qa-dev/` or `.qa-device/`. The maintained docs
describe how to reproduce them; Git history preserves old execution receipts.
