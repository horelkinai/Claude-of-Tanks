# Architecture decisions

This file records the small set of decisions that still constrain the current
game. It replaces the former directory of per-file migration receipts. Those
receipts described completed work, not alternative designs; Git history keeps
them available without making contributors read hundreds of obsolete steps.

Current behavior is defined by `SYSTEMS.md`, `MULTIPLAYER-ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`PERFORMANCE.md`, `GAME-MODES.md`, and the source code. Add an entry here only
when future work must preserve a non-obvious choice or deliberately reverse it.

## Product scope

Claude of Tanks is a first-party browser armored-combat game, not a loader for
third-party playable models. Every playable vehicle is procedural runtime
geometry owned by this repository. Comparison meshes may support authoring and
review, but public builds and gameplay do not load them.

Multicrew is not a planned mode. One player owns one vehicle input seat. New
multiplayer work should improve rooms, teams, objective modes, persistence,
prediction, authority, and reliability without introducing multiple player
roles inside one tank.

## Checked application graph

The shipped application, server, API, middleware, Vite configuration, and
browser tooling are strict TypeScript. `allowJs` is disabled. `.mjs` is retained
only for Node command, generator, and self-test entrypoints around checked
owners. New runtime JavaScript, type suppressions, and unchecked compatibility
facades are not acceptable substitutes for defining a real interface.

The composition root declares construction order and connects capabilities. A
phase-owned state machine belongs in a focused module with a narrow port and a
Node-runnable self-test. Renderer-free simulation and network authority must
not import browser or Three.js presentation state.

Lazy modules derive their integration types from the loaded owner rather than
duplicating broad compatibility interfaces. The two phase-narrowing bridges
that remain for killcam and deterministic capture validate their callable
surface at runtime before handing staged live entities to the owner. Generic,
unchecked `legacyPort` casts are prohibited.

The strict gate also enables unused-symbol diagnostics for core runtime owners.
This removed the retired per-battle vertex scan that supported external GLB
contact geometry; first-party builders now publish the single validated contact
receipt used by both solo authority and network prediction. Fleet-profile and
map-factory signatures remain outside that narrow gate until each family can be
changed with its visual and geometry proof intact.

## Fixed-step authority

Movement, ballistics, armor, damage, ERA, spotting, bots, match modes, and
results advance on a deterministic 60 Hz authority clock. Rendering is
variable-rate presentation. Randomness is seeded or injected, and clients never
decide hits, damage, reload completion, hidden-enemy disclosure, or match
results.

Solo, browser-hosted private/LAN rooms, and dedicated matches share the same
headless combat rules. Player identity is separate from vehicle identity, so
duplicate tank selections remain valid.

## Loading and resource ownership

Garage readiness does not require a battlefield, solo-authority graph, combat
effects graph, complete fleet, or multiplayer presentation graph. Battle intent
may transfer exact dependencies, but construction of heavy visible resources
belongs behind the covered loading transition.

Visible work yields within a small frame budget. Work under an opaque loader
uses cooperative task yields and guarantees periodic real paints. Slow progress
is not treated as failure; failed imports and graphics-context loss remain
retryable without a refresh loop. Public first-visit performance is measured in
multiple cache-disabled sessions under constrained network and CPU conditions.
Optional workers are accelerators, never lifecycle dependencies. Each worker
task has a bounded deadline and an equivalent local fallback, so a browser that
neither starts the worker nor reports an error cannot strand boot or battle
entry. The cloud-texture worker currently yields to the exact synchronous bake
after three seconds measured from worker creation.

Fleet acquisition is exact-family demand loading. Regional bundle modules and
playable GLB fallbacks are retired. Inactive Garage, world, battle, Studio, and
combat-effects resources have explicit residency limits and phase-scoped
disposal. The reusable FX pool detaches and releases renewable GPU allocations
outside Battle or Studio, then restores behind the next covered warm.

Garage boot imports only the lightweight battlefield catalog: stable ids,
display names, and the exact neutral fallback sky. Full battlefield configs are
loaded behind explicit battle or outdoor-Garage intent. The synchronous full
registry remains available to headless and authoring consumers, but it must not
re-enter the initial browser graph merely to label a picker.

The Garage retains only the inert browser-session shell for multiplayer.
Room coordination, lobby warming, battle launch, activation, and presentation
orchestration load together behind explicit Private, LAN, or Ranked intent.
Their circular lifecycle links are assembled only by
`networkBattleComposition.ts`: round teardown, rematch, lobby preparation,
presentation activation, and transport closure cannot be rewired independently
inside `main.ts`.
The common Bots preload list must contain no bridge, room-chat, signaling, or
network-presentation work. A failed first acquisition is retryable and must not
poison later room attempts in the same page session.
The demand-loaded battle HUD and damage panel are one phase-owned application
runtime. Every acquisition reapplies the current directional-hit setting and
queues the active minimap; replay veiling changes both surfaces atomically.
The composition root must not retain a second set of HUD lifecycle latches.

Desktop boot does not transfer touch-control or mobile-auto-aim chunks. One
retryable mobile input access owner joins both dependencies only after a touch
battle entry and retains the active lock and sound-toggle state outside the
composition root.
Settings, pointer recapture, disconnect presentation, and Garage frame pacing
read one synchronous battle-phase policy so a result, dead player, killcam, or
covered loader cannot acquire subtly different meanings across browser owners.
Renderer-lifetime combat warming has one owner in
`app/combatWarmComposition.ts`. Opening and rare shader generators, the private
HDR target, deployment-shadow preparation, Studio FX warming, and deferred
rollout work reset and cancel together after context loss or phase exit; the
composition root must not recreate those latches independently.
Solo rollout never adjusts the reveal camera. A separate typed entry owner
selects the requested vehicle/map and, on any cold-load failure, restores and
paints Garage state behind opaque coverage before fading the loader.
Engineering drive controls sit behind an inert typed facade. Ordinary players
transfer no drive-test implementation; development, automation, and explicit
debug intent join one retryable import while earlier callbacks remain stable.
The intentionally exhaustive full-fleet QA entry sequence is itself a
demand-loaded owner; `main.ts` does not make ordinary players parse its
parallel acquisition policy.
Solo loading, exact deployment warming, and Garage return/rematch are likewise
accessed through stable typed facades backed by `app/lazyRuntimeOwner.ts`.
Concurrent first callers must coalesce, a rejected acquisition must remain
retryable, and their concrete option graphs must not be constructed during
ordinary Garage boot.

## World and Garage lifecycle

`worldBuildCoordinator.ts` owns transfer, chunked construction, cancellation,
cache limits, and eviction. `worldActivationRuntime.ts` exclusively owns the
active world, atmosphere, collider/minimap readiness, covered GPU warming, and
dormancy. Callers use that interface instead of retaining parallel map state.

The Garage and battlefield have exclusive scene residency. The Garage sleeps
its frame clock after presentation settles and invalidates it only on actual
activity. Verdant retains the authored workshop. Every other Garage destination
uses a purpose-built Garage-only terrain, seven connected map-specific
structures, a two-sided maintenance facility, operating service machinery, and
stocked equipment/part racks. Tank-shaped scene-pack proxies are forbidden; one
post-ready shared workshop streams complete fleet-exact vehicles and teardown
parts for all ten environments. The static environment packs may borrow palette,
relief, vegetation, and industrial language from a battlefield, but never import
or construct its terrain, collision, destructibles, services, or animated
vegetation. Cinder Junction additionally owns three complete raised
rail roads, platforms, canopies, and a nine-bay roundhouse frame.
Background fleet exhibits preserve full geometry and fittings but intentionally
do not inherit player camouflage. They share three map-free `MeshStandardMaterial`
service palettes and omit unused colour/UV/tangent transfer channels. This is a
Garage-presentation decision only; playable and pedestal material contracts are
unchanged. The normal worker path exclusively owns the four required builders;
the render-thread fleet facade is loaded only as an explicit recovery path.
`garageEnvironmentPresentationRuntime.ts` owns the fixed isolated anchor,
camera framing, battlefield dormancy, and diagnostics. The composition root
supplies concrete presentation ports but cannot request a world from this path.
`garageWorkshopDiagnostics.ts` owns the stable engineering surface for Garage
variant probes. It exposes immutable snapshots and explicit build/select
commands; `main.ts` does not assemble workshop receipts from scene internals.
Return-to-Garage is not complete until renewable GPU resources and the final
Garage camera/sun cascade maps have both been rendered offscreen. The return
transaction then freezes those exact depth maps before its first visible color
frame; an idle watchdog must never become the first consumer of pending CSM
work.

## Rendering and shadows

Quality changes presentation cost, never game rules. Static geometry may be
batched or instanced only when appearance, ownership, transforms, and disposal
remain equivalent. Visible vehicle silhouette and authored detail are preserved;
triangle reduction is acceptable only when visual comparison proves parity.
Garage environment geometry is a distinct presentation asset, not a reduced
battlefield: its terrain grid, perimeter instances, and landmark are authored
for the Garage camera and capped by the Garage probe. Pack scenery is immutable,
merged, and receive-shadow-only; the hero/podium remain the dynamic shadow
owners. A stable shadowless bounce light keeps camouflage legible without an
extra depth map or light-count shader variant.
Temporary vehicle materials are not part of static wreck fidelity: once the
factory output is deterministically collapsed to the world's vertex-colored
wreck material, the factory uses a typed geometry-only material adapter and
must not paint discarded PBR textures. Geometry-stream hashes and bounds, not
the presence of temporary canvases, prove parity for that optimization.
The production renderer remains Three.js WebGL. WebGPU/TSL, whole-renderer
workers, BVH acceleration, and new batching layers require an isolated measured
win before adoption; none is a default cure for unrelated CPU, shader, or
readback costs. Deterministic static textures are baked offline when practical,
while unavoidable runtime pixel work uses bounded workers with local fallback.

Cascaded shadow projection and its depth map are updated atomically. The near
pair refreshes on every presented frame; the rate-capped far pair is added as
one coherent cohort at 20 Hz and shares one camera and vegetation-LOD
timestamp. Every snapped light pose moves only with the depth map that owns it.
Keeping the near maps current on far-refresh frames prevents the foreground
from sampling a one-frame-old camera pose, while the atomic far pair prevents
CSM fade from blending two distant shadow states. Bias scales with physical
texel size. Cascade fitting is dirty-driven by the exact camera world matrix,
projection matrix, sun direction, and explicit frustum/map-size invalidation.
Moving casters still redraw on the unchanged production cadence; a stationary
camera no longer recomputes four identical light-camera fits. Temporal ambient
occlusion rejects disoccluded depth history so trees, structures, and
overlapping geometry cannot flash stale darkness.

## Aiming and vehicle presentation

The screen aim request, camera reticle, turret solution, and physical gun bore
share one typed controller. Traverse, elevation, and depression limits constrain
the solution; multiplayer presentation consumes the same requested aim as solo
instead of inventing a second camera-relative target.

Turret, gun, recoil, wheels, track links, suspension, modules, crew, armor, and
ERA have explicit articulation owners. Track geometry conforms to terrain while
authority preserves rigid-body airborne motion, rollover, stacking, and contact.
ERA is consumed once by authority and its matching tile presents a destructive
activation effect.

## Multiplayer connectivity and persistence

Private internet rooms use same-origin durable signaling plus operator-supplied
ICE. TURN credentials are short-lived and issued from server secrets; long-lived
relay credentials never ship to browsers. An unavailable ICE endpoint falls
back to browser host candidates rather than silently contacting a public STUN
service. LAN rooms avoid internet ICE services entirely.

Room membership survives transient transport loss and page reload. A stable
player ID reclaims its seat through a new page-session and RTC generation;
rooms retain their lobby through results and rematches. Reload during a live
round restores the same protocol epoch when authority already welcomed the new
transport.

Round cleanup and room teardown are separate operations. Rematch cleanup may
dispose presentation and clear snapshot/input state while retaining signaling
and match ownership. A full close must abort an in-flight entry, close its
transport, and only then clear the room owner. The previous verdict and clocks
are reset synchronously before either a first round or rematch can publish a
new presentation frame.

A cold guest acquires its ICE/TURN configuration before its signaling join
announces membership to the host. WebSocket connection and ICE discovery may
overlap, but the host cannot start sending SDP and candidates until the guest
can immediately construct its peer session. Room creation remains parallel
because a new room code is undiscoverable until creation returns.

Signaling delivery is replayable, duplicate SDP is idempotent, data lanes and
ICE generations are replaceable, and recovery is bounded. Snapshot clocks slew
toward new offset estimates instead of jumping. Local prediction replays shared
movement rules and applies bounded role-aware correction; remote presentation
interpolates without revealing hidden state.

## Public repository evidence

Tracked tests are release contracts and must be registered in the ordered test
inventory. Generated audits, traces, screenshots, task notes, and agent handoffs
belong in ignored QA directories or external artifacts. Repository-level and
subsystem skill documents are retained only when indexed and when they define a
real ownership boundary.

Maintain one current document per subject. Raw benchmark runs and completed
migration narration belong in Git history; current docs state the invariant,
the reproduction command, and the evidence required to change it.

## Required proof

Every architectural change runs the nearest focused self-test, strict
typechecking, the ordered test suite, and the relevant public/private build.
Rendering work also needs current browser evidence and resource/performance
gates. Multiplayer claims require pristine browser contexts, impaired delivery,
disconnect/reload recovery, a complete match, and production TURN verification
when restrictive-NAT connectivity is claimed.

An opaque battle-entry cover suppresses incomplete or redundant scene renders;
it never suspends signaling, RTC, authority, or snapshot progress. Private,
LAN, rematch, and ranked entry acquire that cover synchronously before their
first asynchronous dependency. The cover releases only after one complete
battle frame has presented from the final world and camera pose. A cold import
failure releases the cover before the loading veil leaves or Garage resumes.
