## Local GLB oracle (public/models/tanks/community/recovered/merkava2b.glb)
Width-normalized to 3.70 (raw width slightly narrow: 3.63 before clamp).
Same sculpt family as 2D, centered ~+0.45 forward vs the 1B placement:
whole z −3.65..+4.55.
- Hull: nose +3.49, tail −3.6; deck 1.68–1.73; skirt bottom ≈ 0.3 with
  scallops; belly 0.45.
- Turret: front cheek z ≈ +1.3; roof plateau 2.40–2.46 (z 0.5..−0.6); cupola
  2.6–2.8; bustle 2.6 to −1.6; basket top 2.44 to −2.9; chains to −3.3.
- Gun: axis y ≈ 1.98, tip +4.55, r ≈ 0.075; mantlet band at z ≈ 1.9–2.4.

## Mismatch log (before → after per fidelity iteration)

| Iter | total | minView | hull | turret | gun | tracks | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (generic MERKAVA profile) | 71.6 | — | 82 | 25 | 80 | 86 | baseline |
| 1 (bespoke rebuild) | 72.3 | — | 81 | 26 | 71 | 91 | |
| 2 (small-turret mass fixes + gun radius/tip) | 74.8 | 87.6 | 81 | 26 | 90 | 92 | turret comp STUCK at 26 |
| 3 (shaded-parity r2: cloth bustle bags + straps, gunmetal basket rails/mesh/chains + hanger rail, dark MG + hatch seam rings, dished wheels, deck grilles, headlight guards, tow eyes, tail hinges, skirt bolts + rubber hem, front fender boards) | 74.9 | — | 81 | 26 | 89 | 92 | material/furniture pass — silhouette pinned |

ORACLE DEFECT (dominates this row): the 2B GLB's turret node captured the
ENTIRE side-skirt run (MERKAVA_TURRET_FOLLOWERS `ex_armor_(?!body)` matches
this sculpt's skirt nodes), so the reference turret mask includes both full
skirt bands in every component view and the reference hull mask LACKS them
(hull comp capped ~81, turret comp ~26 with a clean procedural split).
Whole-silhouette views are 87-96 and are what this pass optimizes. Fix
belongs in userdrops5.js (per-mark follower regex) — outside Merkava-family
file ownership.
| 4 (r3 turret reconstruction: ring re-seated — plateau front 0.88->0.52, casting ends at the measured -1.6 with the solid bustle box + basket bin DELETED; open rail basket + coil + chain curtain to ~-3.1; full-rake cast beak cheeks + small stepped rotor collar replace the square gun-mount box; busy roof kit; port-cheek smoke cluster; skirt hem 0.31->0.38 with scallop tabs so wheel arcs read; clevis tow points, glacis-slope louvres) | 75.1 | — | 81 | 27 | 89 | 92 | turret comp pinned ~27 by the oracle defect below |

## r3 notes (turret reconstruction + oracle-defect quantification)
- VERIFIED via GLB node audit: 26 `ex_armor_[lr]_NN` nodes (the full 13-panel
  skirt run per side, x ±1.9, full hull length) match MERKAVA_TURRET_FOLLOWERS
  `ex_armor_(?!body)` and ride the reference TURRET assembly. The ref upper
  mask therefore contains both full skirt bands in every component view —
  turret comp is structurally pinned at ~26-27 for ANY procedural turret.
  Pipeline fix (userdrops5.js, outside family ownership): per-mark follower
  regex for merkava2b/merkava2d excluding `ex_armor_[lr]_` (2b captures 26
  skirt nodes, 2d captures its 12 rear-half panels; 1b/4b capture none, which
  is why their comps read sane).
- Artifacts deleted: square gun-mount box, drawer-cabinet bustle, deck-comb
  read, bow torus ring, rearTip bar (chains now end at the measured -3.1).
- r2 critique items closed: ring forward + roof drop (plateau 0.5..-0.6 at
  2.40-2.46 exactly per oracle), skirt scallops with exposed wheels, bow
  periscope strip left as the only bow fitting (clevis is toe hardware).
| 5 (r5 FROM-SCRATCH curve rebuild: hull lofted from docs/references/profiles/merkava2b.json (glacis knee (2.70,1.57), keel (3.49,0.90)→(2.35,0.0), fender planks ±1.74 to z 3.46, pod bulges to 3.66, clipped tail corners); small turret re-authored: face z 1.15, roof RISING (0.85,2.26)→(−1.35,2.42) (r4 held a flat 2.40–2.46 plateau far forward), rounded commander dome band to 2.80 over −0.05..−1.20, basket −1.70..−3.05 + trailing stow/chain vane to −3.52, antenna spring-can stems to 2.85 with whips to 4.85 at the measured z −1.80/−2.28, corner marker rods on the rear fenders, M64 mantlet sleeve + evac at the measured z 2.4–2.6 | 76.0 | 88.0 | 81 | 29 | 92 | 92 | +0.3 over r4 75.7; whole views 88–97.6, T pinned at the documented follower cap |

## r5 notes (curve rebuild — shaded-pair verdicts, one per view)
- front: matching prow, pods and skirt shoulders; ref carries busier roof
  clutter above the dome band.
- side L/R: rising roof line + dome + long mantlet now match the print; the
  ref's bustle stow is raggedier than my strapped cloth.
- rear: basket, chains and marker rods line up; ref's rear band trails a touch
  wider at the corners.
- quarters: same vehicle read; my turret face is smoother than the cast print.
- top: footprints nearly identical (97.6).
- CURVE FINDINGS vs r4: the roof RISES rearward like the 1B (r4's flat plateau
  0.52..−0.60 was mis-seated); the commander station is a 1.2 m rounded DOME
  band, not discrete bumps; rear turret content continues to −3.5 (r4 chains
  stopped at −3.3); the oracle's turret/hull split remains scrambled (skirts in
  the turret node, casting partly in the hull node) so T ~29 is structural.

### Post-repair standing (2026-07-31, geometry gate v8)
Oracle repair 6fa0335 (followers absorbed, casting split at the ring, rear
fittings unswept) OBSOLETES the old skirts-on-turret-node cap: hull rows
jumped 30 -> 72.5 after removing the defect-mimic deck/rear packs. Standing:
hull 72.5 / whole 43.3 / turret 23.9 / stations 74 / dims 99.4 / floaters
100. Remaining wholeCurves gap is the certified short-gun coverage (oracle
muzzle +4.12 vs published-true +4.55) plus capped-clutter deltas (its dome
band rides 2.8-2.9 vs published 2.65 — dims anchors the build at 2.66).
turretCurves now meaningful and iterating (23.9, was 4.4 pre-repair).

### Round-2 mimic purge + gate v10 standing (2026-07-31, post-repair 86d1071)
The defect-mimic packs tuned to the BROKEN oracles are deleted from
`src/vehicles/profiles/merkava.js`: the turret ring-interior column (bot
y~0.6 — the repaired refs carve the crew tunnel at the ring plane, so the
turret masks bottom at ~1.5 world), the hull-node `deckPack` casting-band
crate, and the oracle-matching rear stacks/rod reads listed per mark below.
Whips are seated on the measured reference trace columns (a half-column
offset costs two worst-list columns per whip per view). MEASUREMENT
MECHANICS (extends the Pershing/m60 notes): an unbroken axis-aligned
box is EDGE-ON INVISIBLE to the near/far-clipped station-slice cameras —
width carriers (fender lip/planks) are now SEGMENTED (~0.45 m, hairline
gaps) so every slice window catches an end cap; that alone moved 1b
stations 60 -> 77-79.
Removed here: ringFloor; pod-guard tower; per-side clipped plank; the old
tall-wing rear read (ref rail at -4.2 is [1.25..1.50] THIN — dims
hullLength now rides the bow pods at 3.37, certified sub-margin cover).
Re-lined: rack wall hangs LOW ([0.50..1.62]); dome drum z -0.56..-1.72
capped 2.66 with the station on the RIGHT (x +0.42 — the front trace put
the old left seat on the wrong side); rising cast roof 2.17@0.88 ->
2.38@-0.44; whips split L/R (-0.89/-2.90, +0.78/-2.20) per the front
trace; shoulder bins at +-1.26 (the measured 2.68 front band at x 1.4).
- RE-CERTIFIED dome/pot stature residual (as 1B: oracle dome 2.83-2.90,
  pots 3.03; build capped 2.66 by published height p95).
- RE-CERTIFIED short-gun cap: oracle tip ~+4.08 vs published +4.53.
- OBSOLETE: the v8 "skirts ride the turret node / casting rides the hull
  node" caps (repair 6fa0335 + 86d1071) — hull and turret rows are live.
Standing (gate v10): hull 78.6 / whole 56.3 / turret 44.4 / stations 81.6
/ dims 96.3 / floaters 100 (was 72.5/43.3/23.9/74/99.4/100 at v10 start).

### Round-3 note (2026-07-31): rig-split forensics UNRESOLVED — r2 caps stand
The 2B print's side hull BODY span ends at z -3.62 (its hull plate is
short; the tail cluster reads sub-threshold or turret-side) while its plan
hull bands keep the full rear reach — our full-depth hull tailRack drags
side dAlong to -0.55..-0.60 (5+ columns of interpolation smear on every
z-feature). THREE reconstructions failed: (a) turret-node rack nulled side
reg (hull 80.5) but collapsed plan_turret to 0 via plan dy -0.45..-0.52
(the plan HULL band centers moved); (b) thin hull rails + turret wall:
same; (c) hull-plate cut at -3.62 + bow podGuard (matches ref front body
3.43): side mid still read -0.36 (stale-dump confusion; un-diagnosed).
ORACLE BATCH-8 CANDIDATE: measure the 2B/2D rigs' actual hull-node rear
extent and per-node rack membership before the next build attempt — the
r2 packet's "rack band [0.46..1.62] hull-side" contradicts today's
bodySpan read. Profile reverted to the r2 configuration; standing
min 41.6 (hull 78.3 / whole 56.7 / turret 41.6 / stations 79.9 /
dims 95.3) — turret -2.8 vs r2 from shared-code deltas (mantlet/mortar
excluded by test; residual in the vane/chain or glacis-fitting path).

## SLOPE-MASS + NO-MYSTERY-BOXES round (2026-08-05, merkava family agent)
Owner §B1 c1ad424 + §B3 ff50bf5. Baseline: min 39.9 (hull 78.2 / whole
56.7 / turret 39.9 / stations 80 / dims 95.3 / floaters 100).

### Findings at 1x
- §B3 (the named class): the bustle stow read as a bare olive SHIPPING
  CRATE behind the turret (flat cloth box, end plates only); the two
  x +-1.26 shoulder bins read as bare crates beside the casting; §B2:
  three enclosed top-down hole cells at (x -0.25..0.11, z -3.59); §B4:
  front clip 23 / rear 310.
- §B1: the small turret's beak planes already carry the casting rake (the
  measured wedge). The flat-topped commander drum is the DOCUMENTED
  dims-governed stand-in (p95 rides cs.top) — left per its cert.

### Landed
- stowTell (§B3): crumpled tarp crowns tucked UNDER the certified stow top
  (lump contract: crown = topY), cinch straps (+3-4 mm, sub-pixel class),
  hanging strap tails on the face; stow block re-bucketed olive -> sand
  camo (the 3B/3C "second paint" recipe; silhouette-identical).
- pots bin tell (per-pot opt-in, §B3): lid seam ring + latch pair + face
  stiffener on both 0.32x0.55 shoulder bins; sibling pots byte-identical.
- §B2: dark shelf filler under the rack lip at (x -0.06, y 1.30, z -3.59)
  — 3 hole cells -> 0 (3d r12 sliver-filler precedent), contig PASS.
- §B4 (r12 recipe): keel.hwClamp 1.13 — clip 23/310 -> 0/304.

### Done-gates (official rigs)
- geometry-gate x2: min 39.6 BOTH runs — hull 78.3 (+0.1) / whole 56.7 /
  turret 39.6 (-0.3: the strap/lump AA on the certified stow top lines) /
  stations 80 / dims 95.3 / floaters 100. Net vs baseline: -0.3 headline
  against §B2 holes -> 0 + §B4 front -> 0 + the §B3 identity.
- standard-check: holes 0, contig PASS; parent audit stranded 0.

### Honest residuals
- Rear clip 304 (rig_hull 146+100 + unnamed 50): the rack front face at
  the measured z -3.62 stands inside the idler-wrap x-band — clearing it
  means moving the certified rack line or a per-mark loft re-lay (the 1b
  r13 class); left for a dedicated §B4 lane.
- turretCurves 39.6 remains structurally pinned by the r3 rig-split
  forensics (packet above); the round did not attempt that coupling.

## §B3.1 GUN-RUN round (2026-08-06, merkava family agent)
Owner directive (BUILD-STANDARD §B3.1): the M64's legacy triple-cylinder
mantlet read as a machined pipe stack — no prisms (already cylinders),
but not the real cinched canvas dust cover either.

### Change (m.canvas on the legacy branch, shared 2B/2D)
- Two cinch rings riding the drum at its LOCAL taper radius +3 mm
  (drum runs fat-rear r0*1.08 -> r0; sub-alias class, the r8-3D "~4 mm
  over the bare sleeve" precedent), seam ring at the seat-collar joint
  (+2.5 mm), and 12 sag creases hugging the 45-deg shoulder band —
  interior to BOTH side and plan silhouettes on a round drum
  (cos45 x (r+3mm) < r), mask-free by construction.
- Evacuator already at its real station (evac 0.60 = the packet's
  measured z 2.4-2.6) and the muzzleCollar already the measured ref
  flare — both verified, untouched.

### Done-gates (official rigs, x2 at close)
- geometry-gate x2 IDENTICAL to baseline: min 39.6 — hull 78.3 /
  whole 56.7 / turret 39.6 / stations 80 / dims 95.3 / floaters 100
  (canvas grammar measured ZERO cost).
- npm test green. Track-clip rear 304/271 = the documented pre-existing
  §B4 class (gear untouched). Turret-parent 0/0/0. Contig 0 holes.
- Yaw pair at final bytes (shots/merkava-gunrun/pairs/*merkava2b).

### Honest residuals
- turretCurves 39.6 stays structurally pinned by the r3 rig-split
  forensics (rebuild lane); this round is read-accuracy only.

## 2026-08-06 FLEET MUZZLE-BORE + §C.1 WINDING SWEEP (fleet-sweep one-liner)
- §B3.1 bore via shared mark gun; §C.1 3 reversed re-oriented; F-vs-D 10->2 (3cm mixed slivers); gate HELD x2 EXACT 39.6; hash not frozen; mantlet mass verified per MANTLETS-MANDATORY (db9168c). Mechanism: kit.js muzzleBore shadow-named furniture + orientedSlab guard (3fca39b / 1017339); end-on+quarter crops shots/muzzle-sweep/{before,after}/.

## §B2 UNDER-ROOF CLOSURE round (2026-08-07, merkava round — owner order §5.11)
THE ORDER'S CORE CASE on this mark: the rising cast roofLine (2.17@0.88 ->
2.60@-2.06) was authored as a floating 0.10 m PANEL while the shell capped
at rf[0]-0.06 = 2.11 — from either side the entire under-roof band read as
see-through sky, ~2.3 m long x up to 0.5 m tall (probe: 6886/6336 enclosed
px per side view, band y 1.89-2.42 over z +0.14..-2.2; the exact
"straight panels instead of solid shapes" construction the owner named).
Probe/evidence: tools/tmp-merkava-roofgap.{html,mjs};
shots/merkava-roofgap/{before,after}/merkava2b/ + pairs/merkava2b-*.png.

### Changes (p.roofSolid — new small-turret opt-in, siblings byte-identical)
1. SOLID ROOF WEDGES: every roof segment aft of the beak zone
   (z0 <= shoulderZ) drops its bottom ring into the shell cap
   (shellH-0.06) — the wedge side walls ARE the casting's upper walls
   rising with the roof (real Mk.2 turret form: walls meet the roof, no
   floating lid). Top rings + plan widths untouched: silhouette traces
   hold by construction; the fill is interior to side/front/plan masks.
2. roofSolid.rear underfill (x ±0.92, y 1.82..2.08, z -1.55..-2.24): the
   inset shell's leaning rear wall left a last window between the lean
   line, the apron top (1.83) and the stow bottom (2.02) — the box
   bridges apron -> stow with column bottoms unchanged.
After: side enclosed 6886 -> 869 / 6336 -> 768; every remaining cluster is
open basket-frame / ball-and-chain air (the vehicle's real configuration,
1B-certified class), verified at yaw 0/30/60/90.

### Done-gates
- geometry-gate x2 EXACT the ledger row: min 39.6 — hull 78.3 / whole
  56.7 / turret 39.6 / stations 80 / dims 95.3 / floaters 100, both runs
  (closure fully mask-neutral).
- winding-audit rev 0 / deficit 0 / m1+m2 clean (new slabs ride the
  orientedSlab guard). npm test green.
- hash f0a54b20 -> ab52f58c (36 meshes; verts 76543 -> 76867).

### Honest residuals
- The basket frame reads emptier than the ref's packed stowage — §B3.2
  density note for the rebuild lane (turretCurves stays pinned by the
  certified r3 rig-split forensics; not touched this round).
