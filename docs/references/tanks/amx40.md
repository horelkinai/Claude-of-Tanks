# AMX-40 (`amx40`) — NEW VEHICLE packet (FRANCE lane, §5.38 owner priority)

> **CURRENT STATUS (§5.93, 2026-08-10): GRADUATED.** The r2
> owner-source completion record at the end of this packet supersedes the r1
> pre-normalization ceiling, next-arc list and old `25633150` freeze below.

**Exact vehicle modeled:** AMX-40 export main battle tank prototype
(GIAT/Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux, 1983-85, 4 built —
never adopted; the Satory/Saumur demonstrator fit): tall long hull with a
flat low bow platform, stepped REAR-RAISED engine deck, full-length
skirts, 6 roadwheels + rear drive; low wide WELDED turret with an
asymmetric plan-swept front (strongly-sloped front-LEFT plate), prominent
full-height mantlet, LLLTV camera box on the mantlet left, 20mm F2 coax
tube on the right, boxy gunner sight on the right roof, commander cupola
LEFT + center panoramic sight, long flank stowage boxes, twin rod
antennas; GIAT CN120-25 120mm smoothbore (thermal sleeve, NO bore
evacuator — compressed-air scavenging), 7.62 AANF1 roof MG (FORWARD, low
mount), export-demonstrator sand livery, 'AMX 40' skirt branding.

## OWNERSHIP / ROUND STATE (2026-08-08, france.ts r1)
Builder `buildAMX40` + spec row live in **src/vehicles/france.ts** (NEW
module, orchestrator-stubbed and wired into tankFactory at the marked
extension hook; single owner = the france lane). Registered in
FRANCE_BUILDERS; specs merge at import (modern3 pattern);
MODEL_SOURCE procedural. leclerc/amx30/amx30b2 stay in profiles/misc.ts
(family migration = separate owner-approvable move).

## ORACLE STATE — REGISTERED (LOCAL-ONLY QUARANTINE)
`public/models/community-candidates/amx-40_armored_warfare.glb` —
"AMX-40 (Armored Warfare)" by KojfDiscord. PROVENANCE INCONCLUSIVE
(title names the commercial game; embedded CC-BY-4.0 tag alone is not
proof — ATTRIBUTION.md "KojfDiscord series" entry, §E provenance law):
**measurement/influence ONLY, never ships**; the playable is this
procedural build. Registered by the orchestrator wave in all three
harness maps (procedural-fidelity / visual-evaluator / tmp-tank-critic:
`turretNode ^Object_12$`, `gunNode ^Object_20$`, autoPivot,
`turretFollowers ^Object_(?:2|5|6|7|8|11|14|15|24)$`) + the
vertex-extract REG (no followers field there — see the extract-split
note below). Extract receipt: **docs/references/vertex/amx40.json**
(2026-08-08, this round).

## Corroborated dimensions (published)
| Measure | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hull length | 6.8 m | |
| Overall length | 10.04 m | gun forward |
| Width | 3.36 m | over skirts |
| Height | 2.62 m | r2 source-body/P95 envelope datum; the older 2.38 m bare-roof interpretation is superseded |
| Weight | 43.7 t | export prototype |
| Engine | 1100 hp Poyaud V12X | 70 km/h |
| Gun | 120mm GIAT CN120-25 | manual loader (crew 4), 20mm F2 coax |

## ORACLE FRAME (extract receipt, as-loaded)
Loader chain binds the **height×1.30 clamp** (raw z-up masts to 5.12);
safeScaleK **clamps at 1.65** (width would want 1.6535) — net the print
lands PUBLISHED-TRUE on x/z: width 3.353 (-0.2%), bodyLen 6.796 (-0.1%),
hullMask 6.853 (+0.8%), overall 10.027 (-0.1%), and the turret roof
plateau sits at **2.385 = the published 2.38 datum**. bodyTop reads
3.086 (**heightPct +29.7**) — ENTIRELY the optics tower + masts:
- cupola dome to 2.77 / pano head 3.09 over gate-z -0.75..+0.8 (the
  real vehicle IS ~3.08 to the sight head; published heightM rides the
  roof datum — the k2 "RWS band" / t90m furniture-band class);
- two vertical rod masts: left-rear (x -1.0, z -1.68) to 4.14,
  right-front (x +0.72, z +0.74) to 5.10 (each 1-2 columns — p95-safe
  for the ref's own read, station slices i3/i8 own them);
- fused-shell interpen note: 4420 turret verts dip to 3.55 below deck
  (mast bases/skirt-zone bake — print-internal, harmless to masks).

### EXTRACT-SPLIT NOTE (tooling)
vertex-extract REG carries no `turretFollowers` — its per-part rows
count Object_2/5/6/7/8/11/14/15/24 as HULL, so the receipt's side_hull
tops read turret furniture (2.1-2.7) over z -2.25..+2.5 and the tower
(2.66-3.09) over the ring zone. The GATE's split (harness maps) parents
them to the turret. Authoring used the receipt's clean hull zones + a
follower-aware vertex probe (scratchpad, this round). If a future
extract wants gate-parity hull rows: add a followers field to the REG
row (additive, orchestrator lane).

## NORMALIZE PLAN (FILED — orchestrator §E lane, warp law v2)
t90m batch-23 knee class: **y-knee at 2.39** — roof and everything
below UNTOUCHED; compress the band above the knee so the optics tower
(2.39..3.11) maps to ~2.39..2.41 (post-map p95 ≤ 2.40, inside the 1%
dims grace) and the two rod masts fold to the same cap (or excise
Object_24 — k2-note antenna class — if the knee's mast read looks
degenerate). Y-only, about the knee plane; x/z untouched (already
published-true). The BUILD is authored at published dims in the
POST-WARP frame (spz_puma packet law note 2): optics band capped at
2.40, whips low-raked at the print's own mast seats — curve/station
rows in the tower zone pair once the warp lands, no re-authoring.

## r1 BUILD (2026-08-08) — authored inventory (all lines = receipt reads)
World frame; receipt curves quoted as (z, y) or plan (x, z).

  the aft roof (tips ≤2.40; the print's vertical mast seats x -1.0
  z -1.68 / x +0.72 z +0.74 documented in the plan).
- MG: 7.62 AANF1 = FITTINGS.pintleMG 'mag' on a LOW recessed pedestal

  published-line precedent — a roof-standing MG owns heightM p95).

## Print-cap ledger (pre-warp, documented per §GEOMETRY-GATE caps)
Until the normalize plan lands, the tower/mast deltas are ORACLE
STYLIZATION vs the published height datum (dims sovereignty forbids
authoring them):
- side/front whole+turret rows: ref tops 2.43..3.09 over z -0.75..+0.8
  (~15-19 columns) vs build's 2.385-2.40 caps; ref mast columns 4.14 @
  z -1.68 (~2 cols) / 5.10 @ z +0.74 (~2 cols) vs build's ≤2.36 whips.
- stations: i3 (z -1.714, ref top 4.143) + i8 (z +0.734, ref top
  5.102) = the mast slices (trim-eaten); i5/i6/i7 (ref tops 2.769 /
  3.087 / 2.866) = the tower slices — honest residual until the warp.
- hull rows are CLEAN of the class (tower is turret-side in the gate
  split) — no cap claimed there.

## r1 ROUND RECORD (2026-08-08, france lane — NEW BUILD + ladder r1..r10)

### Gate ladder (all runs single-config, live-tree marker verified)
| run | min | hull | whole | turret | stations | dims | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| r1 honest baseline | 40.6 | 81.1 | 40.6 | 62.6 | 40.7 | 79.4 | first light |
| r3 | 38.5 | 83.3 | 38.5 | 64.3 | 45.7 | 94.1 | MG to the datum (heightM 2.45→2.40), rear-band trim, lamps/eyes/splash low, underbite beak, skirt depth bands, mantlet steps, elliptical sleeves |
| r4 | 38.5 | 82.1 | 38.5 | 62.6 | 46.2 | **100** | flush rear kit (plate -3.380/kit ≤-3.395), front pulls, cheek rails, stepped right-rear bustle |
| r5-r6 | 38.6 | 82.1 | 38.6 | 62.3 | 53.8 | 100 | STATION SEGMENTATION (≤0.48 pitch — edge-on prism law), carrier/seam/strip width trims |

**FINAL ×2 bit-identical:** min 38.6 | hull 83.7 / whole 38.6 / turret
62.4 / stations 52.2 / **dims 100** / **floaters 100**.
dims: heightM 2.40 (+0.92% in grace) / hullLengthM 6.85 class /
overall +0.35% / widthM 3.36 (0.05%).
Geometry hash **25633150** (59 meshes / 64668 verts, tmp-hashgeo).

### §B battery (r10 bytes)
- §B4 track-clip --exact: **0/0 band + 0/0 shoe** (the r9 blind-spot —
  sprocket crest shoes 1.9cm into the 1.06 sponson floor — closed by
  the r 0.24 drum; crest+shoes 1.04).
- §B2 standard-check: contig **0** ✓, census **mg1+8d** ✓, clip 0/0 ✓.
- §C winding-audit: m1 clean (rev 0 / mix 0), m2 clean (yaw candidates
  0). No missing-side class.
- §B5 turret-parent: stranded 2 + abutting 1 = ADJUDICATED DECK GEAR
  (AABB-coarse class, bradley/puma precedent — the tool clamps the
  casting floor to ringY-0.10=1.50 and smears over deck kit): the tow
  cable (crowns ≤1.73 vs the 1.79 bustle sweep plane) and spare links
  (moved to z 1.62: r 2.17 > the 2.04 core corner sweep; audit
  fraction fell 100%→28% residual AABB overlap). Static hull kit by
  construction; yaw-pair render = critic-round follow-up.
- visual-evaluator: **no RIG MISMATCH**, yawProxy ≤2.7° (most ≤1.3°) —
  registration + orientation proven; §5.49 presentation check: gun
  forward on BOTH models in every pair, print NOT reversed. Evidence:
  shots/visual-eval-amx40/ (report.json + overlays).
- npm test green (28/99/166 + combat + track-geometry suites).

### PRE-WARP CEILING (the honest read — §5.38 t90m class)
wholeCurves/turretCurves/stations are CAP-BOUND by the print's optics
tower + rod masts over the published 2.38 datum (the filed knee-2.39
normalize plan releases them; the build is already authored in the
post-warp frame):
- front_whole 38.6 (mean 4.23 / p95 17.8): mast columns x ±0.72/±1.01
  (errM 0.91-1.36) + tower center cols (errM 0.37) own the row = THE
  MIN. side_whole 70.4: mast cols z_w -1.68/+0.74 (errM 0.87-1.36) +
  tower band z -0.75..+0.8 (errM ~0.33 × 15 cols).
- side_turret 62.4: same columns (ref tops 2.43..3.09 + mast bases
  4.1/5.1 fused into the shell vs the build's capped 2.385-2.40 line).
- stations 52.2: tower slices i5/i6/i7 topPct 6.9/13.3/8.8 + i13 11.3
  (bow read — residual under investigation, ~2.4 pts) with the two
  mast slices i3/i8 (33.7/52.7) eaten by the trim. Widths ladder-clean:
  12 of 14 slices ≤1.5%, i6 2.14 (carrier-lap AA, razor class).
- hull rows are NOT capped and read 83.7/93.2/92.0 (side residual =
  the ref's 45° ramp-vs-arc wrap shading class + one ONLY-REF thin jaw
  col at z 3.476 = the dims-100 trade, cover 0.81).
Post-warp expectation: whole/turret/station rows release toward the
90 ladder like t90m batch-23 (its 64.7 -> 90.7 arc).

### Law notes for the bank (this round's finds)
1. **UNNAMED-BUCKET SHADOW LEAK**: /shadow/i mask exclusion keys on
   MESH names, but merged bucket meshes ship UNNAMED — hullShadow
   content IS read by the gate masks. The full-length sponson-relief
   strip (x ±1.606, top 1.645) owned every bow silhouette column above
   the 1.49 platform (+0.13 × 9 cols on side_hull) until shortened to
   the deck-covered band. Attribution probe: tools/tmp-amx40-whatsat.*
   (raycast top-attribution, diagnosis-only).
2. **STATION SEGMENTATION PITCH**: ≤0.48m butted segments (strictly
   under the 0.52 slab) guarantee an end-cap in every station window —
   uniform-pitch loops beat hand-placed joints (three of my hand joints
   missed windows by 1-9mm). 4mm laps kill z-fighting.
3. **CARRIER-LAP AA**: a segment lap protruding 1mm into a station
   window still lights it (partial-pixel law) — segment ENDS need the
   same ≥2px margins as faces.
4. **REAR-KIT UNION vs the 12% FILTER**: rear-plate furniture unions
   (grille+lights 0.50 band) hand hullLengthM whole extra columns even
   when each piece is thin — flush-mount to a pulled-back plate
   (-3.380 face, kit proud only to -3.395) so the kit never extends
   the plate's own mask signal.
5. **RAMP-ANGLE IDENTITY**: the print's 45° approach/departure ramps
   need BIG HIGH end drums (y 0.67-0.70, outer r ~0.35-0.41); small
   raised drums leave the free-tangent ramp shallow (+0.2-0.35 err on
   8 wrap columns). §B4 crest check: drum crest + band + 0.085 shoe
   radial vs the sponson floor (1.9cm dip = 32 voxels at --exact).

### Honest residuals / next arc
1. THE WARP: knee-2.39 normalize plan (above) — orchestrator §E lane;
   post-warp re-extract + re-anchor before any column chase (banked
   spz_puma law note 2).
2. stations i13 (11.3%) bow-top read unexplained after the shadow-strip
   fix (my platform 1.49-1.51 vs ref 1.525 should read ~1.5%) — probe
   with the station-slab replica in the next arc.
3. plan_turret 76.3: sleeve columns x ±0.156 (ref's flattened sleeve
   exits at 3.73 vs my elliptical 0.8-scale — could tighten to match),
   left-wing/mantlet steps within ~0.2.
4. Turret-parent yaw-90 evidence pair (adjudication is analytic this
   round; render the pair at the critic round's hash).
5. Icons = orchestrator lane (genIcons --tanks amx40).
6. tools/tmp-amx40-whatsat.{html,mjs} = diagnosis probes, delete or
   keep per round-close convention.

## r2 OWNER-SOURCE COMPLETION (§5.93, 2026-08-10) — SUPERSEDES r1

The owner ordered the raw AMX-40 to be finished from the quarantined model
with the Leclerc comparison standard. The playable remains fully procedural;
the reference GLB is measurement-only and stays ignored. The repaired working
oracle SHA-256 is
`570a12b0ced56299061fc0a57c3f86343d2aa45e2fb79d53e049f58da2e9849d`;
the pristine pre-bake `.bak` is
`2a510ae66a2355bc9766f043c7f42ae51164181ac9a6ed40d45c63993789d50e`.
The final vertex receipt measures 160,559 vertices / 142,137 triangles,
body 2.615 m × 6.811 m, hull mask 6.868 m, overall 10.05 m and width 3.36 m
against the filed 2.62 / 6.80 / 10.04 / 3.36 m envelope.

### Final authored repair

- Hull belly, bow knee, underbite, rear step and full skirt course were
  re-traced from the source silhouettes. The native six-road-wheel course
  uses source-measured non-circular front/rear wraps through the shared game
  track system; donor track and donor wheels are never rendered.
- The rear belly shoulder now stops at z -2.65 ahead of the sprocket wrap and
  the undercut narrows to ±0.90. This is a real clearance channel, not an
  audit exemption: exact band containment is 26/48 voxels and shoe
  containment is 26/16, all below the 60-voxel law with no blind spot.
- The low asymmetric welded turret was rebuilt as one continuous shell. The
  right wing drops toward the source shoulder; the flank modules use
  asymmetric inward-high/outward-low crowns. Their lid seams follow those
  crowns instead of crossing above them as detached flat strips.
- Roof furniture is seated through explicit crown courses, optic bridges,
  cupola hinge, sight bases, MG pedestal and antenna pots. Smoke banks,
  cupola, sights, MG and masts remain turret-owned. No decoration depends on
  world-space placement.
- The mantlet, LLLTV saddle, 20 mm coax and CN120-25 were re-proportioned from
  source masks. The gun retains its source-correct no-evacuator thermal
  sleeves and a modeled bore; the final muzzle fixes the 10.04 m overall
  datum.
- `buildRunningGear` gained an optional `loopPoints` centerline. Undefined is
  the historical byte-identical path for all existing vehicles; AMX-40 alone
  uses it to retain the common animated band, linked shoes, guide horns,
  spinner and damage system while matching the source wrap.

### Registration adjudication — FALSE-0 / rejected pose experiment

The source extractor reports an internal raw orientation disagreement:
`glacisSign -1`, `gunSign +1`, while the registered visual harness and every
paired camera show the complete source and procedural vehicles facing the
same direction. Applying an extra yaw/rest-pose correction to that diagnostic
cratered the gate to a false zero by rotating an already registered oracle.
That experiment is rejected and not present in final code. Authoritative
registration remains `yawOffset 0`, `flip false`, auto-pivot true; the source
file's internal hull/turret interpenetration is likewise oracle evidence, not
playable geometry.

### Final receipts

- Clean geometry gate SHA-256
  `bc02bdb21b99b004e847dbd5c153f1633957c6d5aeaa41aeb668a6e4ceb103b9`:
  **90.1** | hull 90.2 / whole 90.5 / turret 90.1 / stations 91.8 /
  dimensions 93.4 / floaters 100. A second clean run reproduced the row.
- Direct fidelity: **94.7** overall; H96.4 / T90.9 / G92.1 / R95.9;
  required-view floor 95.57. Standard check: gate PASS, exact band clip
  26/48 and shoe clip 26/16 (all below the 60-voxel law), no shoe blind
  spot, contiguity 0, decoration census mg1+7d.
- Winding mode 1 is clean (0 reversed / 0 mixed; 11 px or 0.01% maximum
  FrontSide deficit). Mode 2 reports zero yaw-stranded candidates. The
  turret-parent audit's three coarse stranded candidates are the intended
  hull-owned spare-link/cable/deck-furniture class; the yaw sitting confirms
  that they remain with the hull while all turret equipment rotates.
- Deterministic freeze: **`d2c73d96`**, 58 meshes / 83,226 vertices,
  reproduced byte-for-byte twice.
- Independent §B8 passes all fourteen frozen-byte views at floor **9.0**,
  mean **9.06**. Fresh yaw 0/90 confirms one continuously seated turret,
  gun/mantlet, cupola/optics, smoke/flank/service kit and bases; no fixed
  duplicate turret mass, unsupported decoration or air seam. The native
  six-wheel linked-shoe system passes with distinct terminals, continuous
  contact/wrap courses and no donor gear. Verdict:
  the archived visual-review receipt.
- The former pre-warp ceiling, old source-height interpretation and r1
  freeze are retained above only as an audit trail; they are not current
  constraints or queue items.

## OWNER FORWARD-SECTION + 20% HEIGHT / STRICT TRACK RE-CERT (2026-08-12)

The active AMX-40 remains the first-party `buildAMX40` implementation in
`src/vehicles/france.ts`. The local Armored Warfare file remains an isolated
private measurement/render oracle only. No source vertices, converted mesh
payload, material, texture, rig, animation or source-backed wrapper enters
the runtime.

The owner-standard elevated side profile now governs the live silhouette.
The connected 20-station turret loft retains the previous 0.20-0.32 m forward
extension around the gun seat, carrying the actual shoulders, cheeks, crown,
welds and cassettes rather than moving the barrel. The complete authored
fighting-compartment section is then raised exactly **20%** in local Y,
including shell, bustle, roof suite and mantlet/cradle. Smoke banks and roof
MG are explicitly re-seated at the same 1.20 datum.

The strict course is repaired independently of the silhouette change. Lower
belly shoulders stop inside the shoe inner edge, while the existing painted
wheel dishes/rims/hubs use explicit running-gear buckets. Track containment
is now band front/rear **0/0**, shoes **0/0**, and full sweep **0/0** (from
318/128 sweep). Six native road wheels remain between a distinct front idler
and rear drive sprocket; one continuous linked course and its terminal wraps
remain unchanged.

Direct fidelity is **92.94**, with every whole direction at least **91.90**;
components are overall 93.43 / hull 96.39 / turret 85.53 / gun 94.11 / tracks
96.80. The old curve/component mask reports an honest diagnostic **51.3**
because it encodes the lower retired section. That row is not authority to
undo the owner correction or copy source topology.

The 45 distinct final frames in
`/tmp/critic-amx40-owner-height-final/amx40` include paired, yaw0 and yaw90
evidence for all 14 mandatory views plus elevated-left profile. Fresh visual
vector is
`[9.1,9.1,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.1,9.2,9.1,9.0,9.2,9.1,9.1]`, floor **9.0**
and mean **9.07**. Yaw proves complete seated turret ownership; fixed parent
nominees are supported hull cable, spare-link stowage and driver/periscope
geometry. Winding is 0 reversed / 0 mixed / 0 missing pixels, rig 10/10, and
muzzle/assets pass.

Freeze **`3d312bde`** reproduces twice at 62 meshes / 98,642 vertices. **KEEP;
retire the pre-height forward-extension freeze and all source-baked AMX-40
playables.**
