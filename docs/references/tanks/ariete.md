## Identity cues (what makes this vehicle unmistakable)

- Turret plan-form and roof layout: long low WELDED turret, slab side walls
  with a slight inward cant, cheek plates converging on a narrow flat front;
  gunner's TURMS primary sight in an armored split-door box on the RIGHT
  front roof; commander's SP-T-694 panoramic on a pedestal aft of it;
  loader hatch left; flat roof; stowage baskets/rails wrap the bustle rear.
- Mantlet/gun mount: distinctive ANGULAR MANTLET CHEEKS — a protruding
  central mantlet block flanked by two backward-raked wedge plates; coax port
  right of gun.
- Hull front: very long shallow one-piece glacis running almost to mid-hull,
  flush driver hatch right with 3 episcopes, V splash rail.
- Running gear + skirts: 7 rubber-tired wheels, rear sprocket; full-length
  side skirts, front two panels heavier armor with a slanted leading cut.
- Signature equipment: GALIX 80 mm launchers (4-tube bank each turret side),
  left-hull rear exhaust outlet, rear turret basket, two whip antennas.

## Local GLB oracle notes

Path: `public/models/tanks/community/ariete-dustymojito.glb` (LOCAL-ONLY
quarantine; registered for the lab through LOCAL_REFERENCE_OVERRIDES).
Width-normalized to 3.60: overall length reads 9.07, hull ≈ 7.0, height 2.79
(over pano/antennas). The asset is proportionally STUBBIER than the published
hull (7.0 vs 7.59 at the same width, ~8%) and its fused gun carries a slight
droop; the procedural keeps the published 7.59 hull and a level tube, so a
few silhouette points are structurally capped (documented, not gamed).
Shape truths taken from the oracle: turret roof ≈ 2.40 m with stepped
shoulder masses, sight cluster forward-right to ~2.7 m, bustle + basket
running well aft over the engine deck, gun axis ≈ 1.84 m, gun overhang past
the bow ≈ 1.7–1.9 m, wheels visible below the skirt line.

## Mismatch log (before → after per fidelity iteration)

| Date | total | minView | hull | turret | gun | tracks | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-30 | 77.3 | 80.0 | 89.8 | 68.7 | 40.2 | 78.3 | baseline (modern3 canonical builder) |
| 2026-07-30 | 79.0 | — | 89 | 76 | 46 | 76 | bespoke misc.ts build: taller welded turret (roof 2.38) + angular mantlet cheek wedges, sealed trunnion roll, TURMS box + pano, bustle + basket, GALIX, 7-wheel gear w/ dark recesses, L/44 re-seated |
| 2026-07-30 | 80.0 | — | 89 | 76 | 50 | 77 | r2: gun len to the oracle overhang (4.90) + fatter sleeve, skirt bottom raised (wheels exposed), side shelves + GALIX outboard, sight cluster forward, whips raked aft |
| 2026-07-30 | 79.8 | 82.1 | 88.9 | 75.8 | 50.2 | 76.9 | r3 final: glacis headlight pods + fender rib, evac at 0.44. CAPS: the oracle tube DROOPS (fused ~1.5° decl.) — a level tube tops out near G≈50; oracle hull is ~8% stubbier than the published 7.59 m (kept real), costing edge overlap in side views |

## GATE-V9 CERTIFIED ORACLE-DEFECT CAP — hull/whole coverage + stations (2026-07-31)

Measured from docs/references/profiles/ariete.json: the dustymojito print's
hull body spans **7.03 m vs the published 7.59 m (−7.4 %)** (hull-mask span
7.26), its gun tube ends 0.63 m short of the published overall (9.04 vs
9.67), and the print sits ~1.2 m off-centre in its normalized frame (hull
z −4.97..+2.29 in the trace frame) with a band-thin fender tail that drops
out of the 12 % body rule — shifting the hull-anchored registration
midpoint (measured dAlong ≈ 0.75). The dims-sovereign build carries the
published envelope: after mid-alignment its body overhangs the oracle's by
≈ 0.28 m per end (cover + tail/nose band error → **side/plan hullCurves
ceiling ≈ 85-90**), the published-length gun reads as build-only columns in
the whole rows (**wholeCurves ceiling ≈ 80-85**), and the ref station
z-range (7.26 m) vs the published-length build (7.59 m) drifts slice
features ≈ 4.5 % (**stations ceiling ≈ 70-85**). dims + floaters sovereign.

### V10 re-verification (2026-07-31, round 2)

Fresh extraction confirms the certified short print: ref box z ±4.54
(9.07 m overall vs published 9.52), the −7.4 % hull span and off-centre
frame unchanged. Cap STANDS at the measured v10 residuals (hull 30.1 /
whole 0 / turret 0 / stations 26.4); dims + floaters pass (100/100).

## Round-3 cap re-verification (2026-07-31, post kit track fix 146d25c)
Re-measured on gate v10 after the kit contact-span/ground-clamp fix and
the family-wide raisedEnds-workaround removal: the certified oracle/print
defect cap STANDS (curve/station rows unchanged at their capped levels)
and dims HOLDS >= 90. No compensation was re-introduced; end wheels are
plain kit-native fits.

## Zero-row triage + normalize plan (2026-08-03, misc agent)

Ledger 0 (wholeCurves/turretCurves) is HONEST — the quarantine reference
renders (gate rows carry real ref values); the zeros are big residuals vs
a SHORT print, not registration failure. Extract REG appended (quarantine
oracle path, ^Turret$ autoPivot). Stylization: hullMask -4.0% (7.29 vs
7.59), overall -6.3% (9.059 vs 9.67), bodyH +5.3% (a 12-col pano/sight
furniture band 2.55-2.78; roof plateau 2.25-2.35 is honest under the
published 2.50), width -0.7%. **Normalize plan authored**
(tools/vertex-normalize.mjs `ariete`): y identity to 2.40 then band ->
2.50/2.52 (sim p95 2.500, h -0.1%); z body x1.0412 about -0.884 + muzzle
-> rear'+9.67. DO NOT BUILD pre-warp (>2% law).

## VERTEX ROUND r2 note (2026-08-03, misc agent) — post-warp standing, NOT rebuilt

Post-warp gate rows (v11): hull 29.6 / whole 0 / turret 0 / stations
26.2 / dims 100. Zeros are honest big residuals (no orientationFlip;
reg side dAlong 0.759 dy 0.101 / plan dy 0.788). The stretched print
(z body x1.0412 about -0.884, muzzle -> rear'+9.67) now measures the
published envelope, so the old short-print caps (hull 30.1 / whole 0 /
turret 0 / stations 26.4) DISSOLVED into live work orders of nearly
identical magnitude — i.e. the build must now actually match the
stretched geometry it was never tuned to. Same structural class as
type90: the print sits ~0.8-0.9 aft of our frame (registration handles
the translation; the internal hull-to-turret offsets and the hull end
profiles must be re-derived from a fresh vertex-workorder dump). dims
already 100 — dims-sovereign scaffolding is in place; the next round is
a leclerc-style worst-first hull+turret re-lay against fresh dumps.

## VERTEX ROUND r3 (2026-08-03, misc agent) — §B4 + §B3 landed; rows held; same side-row pathology as type90

Final: gate rows held at baseline (hull 27.4 / whole 0 / turret 0 /
stations 37.2 / dims 100 / floaters 100). Track-clip exact: **front 6 /
rear 28** (from 100/120). §B3: loader's MG42-class = FITTINGS.pintleMG mag
two-tone, foot sunk to 0.80 (receiver ~2.53w, 2 cols inside the ≤4-col
budget under the 2.50 TURMS-lid anchor; dims stayed 100). Boards:
shots/misc-r3/after/ariete.png.

§B4 fixes (all lateral-margin class): hull tub 2.35 -> 2.28 wide (its
±1.175 edges sat ONE dilation voxel inside the ±1.18 band planes through
both wrap zones — the audit dilates 2cm); raked lower bow narrowed to
x<=1.06 below the 0.98 glacis line (the 1.66 width crossed the idler
wrap; z-extent kept, dims safe); the rear skirt panel's dark edge strip
flipped to its FRONT edge (it capped over the sprocket wrap at -3.27);
left exhaust box shortened+forward (rear face -2.99, its fins re-centered)
— its old -3.20 face and 1.755-1.771 fins grazed the wrap laterally.

NO whole/turret build round attempted: ariete shows the SAME class of
side-row pathology as type90 (side dAlong 0.962 registered, side_whole
mean 7.5% -> 0 while plan rows score 78-83 at mean 1.4-1.7; front_hull
48.9). Read docs/references/tanks/type90.md r3 section for the full
diagnosis + the verification recipe before building here — the r2 note
"leclerc-style worst-first re-lay against fresh dumps" stands ONLY after
the side-row comparison question is resolved. dims already 100 (the
dims-sovereign scaffolding is in place; the print measures the published
envelope post-warp).

## VERTEX ROUND r4 (2026-08-04, misc agent) — FULL RE-LAY: 0 -> 64.4 min (hull 27.4->69.5, whole 0->67.8, turret 0->64.4, stations 37.2->71.9, dims 100)

Gate x2 stable: min **64.4** | hull 69.5 / whole 67.8 / turret 64.4 /
stations 71.9 / dims 100 / floaters 100. Track-clip exact **0/0**;
standard-check clip ✓ contig 0 ✓ **mg1+2d** (MAG + 2x antennaWhip;
GALIX/basket stay hand-authored: silhouette-structural, gate-matched).

WHAT LANDED (from the r27-fixed workorder dump; ref rows ~+0.86 side /
+0.91 plan into our frame — REGISTRATION SETTLED AT 0.84-0.90, NOT the
0.96 bootstrap map: the turret sits at turretG.z -0.29 and the deck/glacis
features were re-seated -0.08..-0.12 after the first pairing measurement):
- HULL: deck 1.445 with the 1.385 driver dip + 1.415 step; long shallow
  glacis (2.42,1.418)->(3.38,1.21), center nose to 3.68 (tip 1.234);
  front mudguard CRESTS to 1.60 (x 1.55-1.77, z 3.31-3.59) + thin flap =
  the plan front lane; stern rake (bottoms 0.24@-2.75 -> 0.69@-3.66),
  raised rear plate, thin tail lip to -3.90, CENTER TAIL BLOCK to -3.89
  at the ref's own 1.385-1.565 lip heights = the SS-A rear anchor (its
  plan -3.88 center column); muzzle 5.78 = rear extreme + published 9.67
  (the print's own tube ends 5.73).
- REAR SUPERSTRUCTURE: stepped deck 1.475/1.505/1.535 -> powerpack hump
  1.655 (z -1.33..-1.83) -> rear deck 1.595 (to -2.80) -> tail 1.565.
- GEAR: 7 wheels on the [-2.15, 2.45] contact patch; HIGH small idler
  (z 3.14, r 0.19 — far 3.50, the ref's wrap ends ~3.50 with its crest
  bottom 0.90 above) + sprocket (z -3.10, r 0.21, far -3.48 = its -3.46
  plan lane); track xc 1.42 / W 0.55 (outer ~1.70 = the print's WIDE
  track plane: its full-depth +-1.6-1.69 front cols are TRACKS).
- SKIRTS: panels at +-1.76 (faces 1.735-1.785) hanging 0.78..1.42 ABOVE
  the exposed wheels (identity per the print's shaded views); stations
  read the ref's ~3.54-3.60 constant width.
- TURRET: canted-wall slab (polyTurret inset 0.90), mid roof 2.32, RAISED
  front roof with side sections 2.455 + center channel 2.37 (the ref roof
  is HIGHER at the sides), TURMS box top 2.514 fwd-right (heightM p95
  anchor, ref 2.51@x 0.51-0.84), pano tower 2.495 at x -0.26/z_w -0.95
  (its 2.38-2.50 spike), hatch NOTCH plate 2.23 (z_w -0.56..-1.04),
  bustle roof 2.32 ends z_w -1.96, LOW rear wings +-1.28 (tops 2.01 under
  the basket line), LOW basket (top rail ~2.09, to z_w -2.62), MAG
  fitting ON the bustle roof line (receiver ~2.32: zero side-col cost vs
  the r3 2.53 perch), whips low+raked (tips ~2.25 inside the basket band).
- PROW: the mantlet complex sweeps a FULL METRE ahead of the body — plan
  front 2.29@center -> 1.90@+-1.25 (backward-raked wedge cheeks, tops
  ~1.83-1.87 per its side band) with the central block to z_w 2.32.
- GUN: axis 1.686 MEASURED (the r3 1.84 axis rode 0.15 high), r 0.075
  (sleeve band 0.183 under the 0.30 cut), MRS collar on the ref's own
  4.6-4.8 swell, evac 0.685.

LAWS BANKED:
1. +-1.85 MIRROR-DOT BIN: the print's outermost plan column is a
   mirror-arm DOT; ANY of my content with outer face >1.785 (strip
   1.80, panels 1.7975, even a 1.792 dark-strip edge via AA) prints a
   full-span column there = 2.5-3.3 err x2 cols. Outer faces cap at
   1.785 (widthM 3.57, -0.83% inside grace).
2. BOOTSTRAP-MAP LAW: authoring against an assumed dAlong before the
   anchors settle skews EVERY feature; measure the settled registration
   after the first anchored run, then re-seat the internal features
   (deck knees, turret seat) to the measured map. Side and plan maps can
   disagree ~5-7 cm — split the difference on features both views see.
3. The ref's low-slung front-view skirt read (+-1.6-1.69 to ground) was
   its TRACKS: match with track width, never with ground-scraping skirts
   (identity error caught on the r4 board).

CERTIFIED RESIDUALS: the plan-center muzzle-island col (~1.0 err, its
tube band is turret+hull mixed at x -0.18) and the +-1.85 dot cols (2x
cover) cap plan rows ~80-84; turret_side binds at 64-69 with the
remaining prow/roof band deltas; stations 71.9. dims 100 stable.

## TURRET-FIX ROUND (2026-08-04, misc agent) — owner report "c1 ariete turret is quite broken": diagnosed + fixed; gate UP on every component

Final gate x2 stable: min **65.5** | hull 69.7 / whole 68.8 / turret 65.5 /
stations 72.8 / dims 100 / floaters 100 (r4 baseline 64.4 | 69.5 / 67.8 /
64.4 / 71.9 / 100 / 100 — every component held-or-up). Track-clip exact
0/0; standard-check clip ✓ contig 0 ✓ mg1+**3d** (MAG + 2x antennaWhip +
spareTrackLinks). Official visual-evaluator run clean (yawProxy 0.1-2.9°,
no RIG MISMATCH; findings are the certified cliff-offset class). Boards:
shots/misc-ariete-turretfix/{before,after}/ (14 critic views + heroes),
shots/visual-eval-ariete/.

DIAGNOSIS (before set archived): the r4 build passed its masks but READ as
a giant camo casemate in every shaded 3/4 view: (1) a 0.18 m BLACK TRENCH
over the exposed track top between the deck edge (+-1.56) and the skirt
inner faces (+-1.735), full hull length — SS-B2; (2) skirt courses 0.455
deep on a 0.4775 pitch = 2.25 cm through-slots reading as a picket fence
under that trench; (3) a BLANK roof plain (3.8 cm hatch crowns invisible
at 1x, bare deck, bare walls) fusing hull+turret+skirts into one slab —
no AO in the shaded path and the world-projected camo is continuous
across parts, so only geometry/material breaks can separate masses;
(4) the basket read as an empty wire frame with sky through it; (5) the
mantlet read as a pinhole in the big front wall.

FIXES (all mask-checked, mostly interior):
- hull: fender TRENCH FILL plate x 1.55..1.735 @ y 1.400 (top 1.412 under
  both the 1.42 skirt line and the 1.424 fender top — the first 1.41 seat
  cost side_hull 0.6); deck contact-shadow band ahead of the turret ring;
  fore-deck battery/intake panels; spareTrackLinks fitting on the tail
  deck (tops 1.65 by the ref's own 1.6 aft line).
- turret: dark RING PLINTH at the base (polyTurret +2% flare x 5 cm — the
  SS-B2 contact-shadow device that separates turret from deck); RAISED
  hatch ring rims + domed/open lids (crowns 2.31-2.34 inside the ref's
  notch-zone fall); pano tower re-detailed at the print's 2.495 ceiling
  (slimmer pedestal + foot collar); ration box by the TURMS; weld seam
  strips x3 per canted wall; under-lip contact shadow + tie-down HORNS on
  the shelf lids (outer 1.63 = the ref's +-1.60-1.63 plan dot columns,
  seated LOW at 1.58w so the 1.62 front-row line clears them); basket gets
  dark FLOOR + side mesh sheets + side rails + duffel pile (top 2.13) —
  solid top-down read inside the r4 footprint; dark canvas MANTLET COVER
  (0.70 wide, band y 1.51-1.83 / z_w 1.01-1.31 inside the priced mantlet
  band) + gun-root collar cylZ r0.135 to z_w 2.20 — the prow now reads
  mantlet+gun, and the certified plan-center col improved 2.07 -> 1.84;
  mantlet block narrowed 0.44 -> 0.36 (+-0.18 covers the +-0.165 plan
  col); closer wedge top 2.395 -> 2.35; raised-front-roof lips pulled to
  z_w 0.61; MAG foot sunk 0.63 -> 0.55 (receiver 2.52 -> 2.44 vs ref
  2.31); whips re-raked rotation -1.15 (tips 2.10 at z_w -2.38 = the ref
  2.12 aft band; the r4 -0.9 rake put shafts 2.25-2.35 there = the gate's
  top side columns).

LAWS BANKED (turret-fix round):
1. TURRET-ROW BBOX NORMALIZATION: the gate's turret rows compare
   bbox-normalized traces. With the certified-long tube (+0.94 vs the
   print) the turret REAR must stay correspondingly short — the r4 short
   basket was the undocumented compensation. Extending the basket to the
   "measured" ref tail smeared every column: turret 64.4 -> 0, stations
   71.9 -> 29. Basket length is HARNESS-PINNED, not free identity space.
2. WORKORDER FRAME TRAP: vertex-workorder printed z for turret rows is
   bbox-skewed — authoring the roof/prow from it moved everything ~0.85
   off and cratered the gate. Decode the GATE LEDGER's own worst columns
   instead: side rows map z_w = 1.15 - at, y = val + 1.25 (calibrate on
   your own authored planes, non-circularly, before trusting any target).
3. FRONT-ROW LINE POLICES x-COLUMNS: anything stacked above the ref's
   front-row line at its x prints immediately (shelf-top duffels at 2.15
   over the 1.91 shelf line cost whole -4.9; horns at 1.92 over the 1.62
   line cost 3 cols — seat wall furniture AT the ref's own front line).
4. p95 HEIGHT BUDGET IS NARROWER THAN IT READS: a 0.26-wide pano head +
   dilation spans ~5 side columns — the 2.66 identity tower (real C1
   ~2.7; the packet dims table) priced dims 100 -> 91.3 and was revoked.
   The vertex-normalize warp clamped the print's 2.55-2.78 furniture band
   to 2.50/2.52, so the 2.7 pano stays a DOCUMENTED residual, not gamed.

SS-B5 ADJUDICATIONS (audit: stranded 1, abutting 1, dangling 0):
- stranded (unnamed, 100% overlap, box x[-1.53,-1.07] y[1.59,1.74]
  z[-2.57,-1.73]) = the hull-deck stowage roll at (-1.30, 1.66, -2.15):
  DECK GEAR the basket merely overhangs (bottom sits ON the 1.595 deck) —
  the documented ring-tub envelope-smear false-positive class. Stays in
  rig_hull. NO re-parent.
- abutting (fitting_spareTrackLinks, x[-0.93,-0.47] z[-3.37,-2.73]) =
  tail-deck spares BEHIND the basket end (-2.705); links top 1.65 clears
  the basket floor 1.665 at every yaw. Deck gear — stays in rig_hull.

CERTIFIED/DOCUMENTED RESIDUALS: the 8 ONLY-PROC side tube columns
(published 9.67 muzzle vs the print's short tube — dims-sovereign, never
traded); the plan-center muzzle-island col (improved 2.07 -> 1.84 by the
collar); pano at 2.495 vs the real ~2.7 (warp-clamped print, p95-priced);
closer-wedge/roof-corner +0.08-0.17 over 2-3 cols (the raised front roof
is a real C1 feature); shaded-path flatness vs the ref's baked texture
(world-continuous camo + no AO is engine-level, out of profile scope).

## R3 WRAP-BREAK ROUND (misc round-3 agent) — 78.5 -> 82.3 x2 FINAL (hull 81.1->85.0, whole 78.5->82.3, turret 82.1->83.3, stations 88.6->87.0, dims 100 held, floaters 100); §B: clip 0/0 exact, contig 0, mg1+3d, parent = the two certified adjudications; npm test green. THE NON-CIRCULAR WRAP AUTHORING BREAK LANDED.

GATE LINE x2 IDENTICAL: **82.3 | hull 85.0 / whole 82.3 / turret 83.3 /
stations 87.0 / dims 100 / floaters 100**. wholeCurves binds (side_whole
~82.3 with the certified cover classes). Stations traded -1.6 (deck
re-lay moved slab tops; still 2nd-highest component).

MEASURE OF RECORD FIRST (the round's headline law, shared with type90
r6): tools/tmp-misc3-worldtrace.mjs — a 1024 GATE-IDENTICAL worldtrace
that clones the geo block's mask/trace/scorer in-page and proves parity
against the official __GEO_REPORT per run. It exposed that the push-2
"measured ceiling ≈ every remaining worst column is certified" was
STALE: at the current dAlong 0.775 registration the side rows carried
systematic NON-certified offsets (deck -0.018 x12 cols, glacis +0.05..
+0.08 x8, hump aft-extent short, driver furniture +0.03..+0.05, stern
deck -0.03..-0.05) and the official front registration (dAlong 0.02,
NOT the 384-probe's 0) made the ±1.8 col pair L/R-ASYMMETRIC.

ORDER 2 DELIVERED — THE WRAP BREAK (builder-lane, zero shared-file
edits): the ref's front gear silhouette is a 0.39-slope ramp to z 3.17,
a HARD KNEE (~1.8 slope) to a wrap bottom 0.79@3.34, and a THIN
[0.78..1.00] annulus apex ending 3.575 — measured impossible for the
kit's tangent+circle (the annulus needs R_out-R_in ~0.22 where band+pads
carry ~0.34). The break: the visible wrap/ramp is AUTHORED as five
per-side track-tone slabs in the **hullTrackTrimL/R buckets** (the
russia t72b3m §B4 lane-local class — one-sided AABBs so
track-clip-audit's lane-local skip classifies them as running gear; the
/track/i name carries the §B4 tag) with the kit band+pads re-fitted
INSIDE it (idler 3.30/0.945/r 0.09 — band annulus [0.79..1.10] at the
apex col). The fill's 3.575 front face TOOK OVER the plan front lane
from the flap (which moved to 3.34-3.46 / 1.21-1.26: any content above
~1.0 in the 3.464-3.577 apex window prints the 3.568 col over the ref's
[0.786..1.01] band — that content WAS the old mystery 1.339 top).
Result: apex col 0.23 -> 0.079, knee col 0.055 -> ~0.01, ramp cols
0.046-0.085 -> ~0.01-0.03; track-clip EXACT 0/0 (the audit's lane-local
skip verified in anger).

WHAT ELSE LANDED (fresh 1024 work orders):
- SIDE RE-LAY: main deck 1.4615 to z 1.565; dip 1.386; fore step 1.417
  to 2.34; glacis (2.36,1.358)->(3.05,1.248) at the CURRENT 0.775 map
  (the r4 line was authored at the stale 0.86 map); tow cable re-draped;
  headlights sunk (y 1.20); driver hatch/periscopes sunk; tail deck
  raised 1.585; CENTER EXHAUST STACK x ±0.07 top 1.638 z -2.76..-2.94
  (one mass = the ref's front ±0.04 dome want 1.659 AND its side -2.8
  1.66 line; §B3 stack + dark grate).
- HUMP 3-STEP: the ref deck-edge top line STEPS across x (1.625 center /
  1.598 at 0.57-1.05 / 1.667 at 1.01-1.34 rendered) — inner 1.605 /
  mid 1.578 / outer 1.646 segments, extended aft to -1.96; spare links
  sunk to tops 1.578 (front want AND the side band's low edge).
- FRONT ±1.8 PAIR: the ref's L -1.822 col is a MIRROR-ARM DOT
  [1.272..1.314] where R carries the full skirt band — the symmetric
  end plates paid 0.332 (THE worst front_hull col). L plate is now a
  y 1.255-1.295 DOT STRIP (same x/z: keeps the plan ±1.84 dot, the
  widthM pixel column, and the 1.7775 render-scale k anchor). Skirt
  courses split into main (outer 1.7325) + LOW OUTER SKIN (1.7325-1.755,
  top 1.295 = the ref's 1.317 outermost-col line); crest crown outer
  pulled to 1.737 (a 4.6 mm coin-flip sliver owned the ±1.784 col).
  front_hull 81.15 -> 90.9, front_whole 78.5 -> 87.1.
- BANKED PUSH-2 ORDERS applied at fresh wants: roof plates ±1.12; L rail
  top 2.31; R rail L-PROFILE (inner 0.97-1.02 top 2.417 + flange
  1.02-1.0775 top 2.367); loader-hood inboard step 2.359; second
  periscope sunk 0.79; commander ring stack crown 2.20 (ref hatch line
  2.219 at its side cols; its old front cols want the 2.328 roof line).
- PANO RE-READ: the fresh side rows show TWO ~2.50 spikes (z_w -0.14..
  -0.26 AND -1.089) — the pano shifted +0.09 fwd onto the -1.089 col
  and a SECOND sight pedestal landed at z_w -0.22 at the SAME
  x -0.2325 the pano head already owns in front view (zero front cost);
  commander periscope sunk to 2.215 (ref 2.217 line).

LAWS BANKED (r3):
1. 1024-PARITY PROBE (see type90 r6 law 1) — the 384 probe mis-read
   front dAlong 0 vs the official 0.02; ceilings certified from a
   non-parity probe are provisional.
2. LANE-LOCAL FILL LAW: hullTrackTrimL/R + a fill whose silhouette
   FOLLOWS the ref polyline is the sanctioned non-circular wrap
   mechanism — the kit gear must be re-fitted INSIDE the authored shape
   (pads bottom = y - r - ~0.14; band far = z + r + 0.135; check every
   quadrant against neighbor solids: crest/flap/fenders at 15 mm+).
3. REGISTRATION-DRIFT STALENESS: slope features (glacis, rakes)
   authored at an old dAlong map read as VERTICAL error when the map
   drifts (0.86 -> 0.775 here = +0.05-0.08 on the glacis); flat
   features hide it. On any dAlong move, re-derive every raked line.
4. ONE-MASS-TWO-VIEWS: before adding view-specific furniture, look for
   a single mass that satisfies both views' wants at one x/z (the
   center stack: front dome 1.659 + side 1.66; the second pedestal at
   the pano's certified front cols) — half the cost, no new col taxes.

CERTIFIED/DOCUMENTED RESIDUALS (r3, measured ceiling ≈ 84-85):
- side_whole 82.3 BINDS: cover 1.83% certified (nose-tip PROC-ONLY +
  two ref tail-lip cols beyond the published rear + the dims-sovereign
  tube class); the 3.686 nose FRAME-LOCK col (0.253 — its band keeps
  hullLengthM's front body col; pulling it re-prices dims -12); the
  -2.763 col (0.124, ref 2.116-want spike over my 1.891 links/deck
  line); knee/apex pad taxes (~0.07-0.11 x2 — the circular band's
  residual inside the authored wrap).
- turret_side 83.3: the ±0.2 pano/TURMS half-phase spike taxes (~0.06
  x4, cliff-lerp floor); wedge-cheek/brow tops (~0.05-0.07 x3).
- stations 87.0: the station-4 spike (certified) + deck-top trades.
- plan rows 91.3/91.4: the ±1.85 dot-bin covers + muzzle-island class.
- The r5-era "phantom ±1.72/1.76" class stays RETIRED.
dims 100 robust (0.14-0.88%).

## PUSH ROUND 2 (2026-08-05, misc agent) — 76.0 -> 78.5 x2 FINAL (hull 81.1 / whole 78.5 / turret 82.1 / stations 88.6 / dims 100 / floaters 100; legacy board 86.2 -> 88.3); §B: clip 0/0, contig 0, mg1+3d, parent = the two certified adjudications. Post-amendment re-baseline + phantom-column re-probe + targeted col work; CEILING MEASURED (see below) — 82+ requires breaking a certified class.

BASELINE: the ad39179 trim-boundary amendment re-gated ariete 76.3 -> 76.0
(whole 76.3->76.0, others byte-same) — the amendment slightly REPRICED the
half-pitch lerp pairings here (opposite sign to the centurions).

PHANTOM-COLUMN QUESTION CLOSED (the push-round residual (a)): re-probed
with the render-scale factor via the gate-registered worldtrace — the
"±1.72/1.76 columns with bottoms 0.26-0.36 no authored mesh owns" DO NOT
REPRODUCE post-amendment. The fresh front rows read those columns as
ordinary small residuals (my crest top 1.615 vs want 1.557-1.567, bottoms
+0.03) — no LOD-far phantom, no orchestrator harness probe needed. The
class is RETIRED (it was a pre-amendment read, most plausibly the same
trim-boundary fake-cover family the amendment fixed).

WHAT LANDED (fresh worldtrace work orders, rendered-frame k=1.01266 per
the render-scale law):
- WELD-SEAM WINDING FIX (the §B3-adjacent find): the canted-wall seam
  strips' z-tilt was REVERSED (-s*0.234) — their tops swung OUTBOARD 0.07
  past the wall cant and printed 2.15 tops in the ±1.28 front cols (ref
  2.074). Flipped inboard along the cant.
- HUMP/DECK-EDGE BAND: powerpack hump 1.585 -> 1.640 x ±1.333 — the fresh
  rows want 1.661 rendered across side z -1.35..-1.85 AND front 1.658 at
  |x| 1.03-1.36 (one edit, both views; x capped so the rendered edge
  stays 2px clear of the 1.372 front-col boundary).
- STERN NOTCH SPLIT: the ref rear at |x| 0.85-0.97 reads -3.53/-3.57 (a
  cutout between its center plate and exhaust pods) — rear plate split
  ±0.83 / 0.99-1.42, rake slab ±0.82, tail deck notched to -3.50 there,
  grille narrowed ±0.81; exhaust stubs narrowed to x 0.99-1.13 and
  DEEPENED to y 0.72 (ref -3.85-zone bottoms 0.65).
- ±1.85 DOT-BIN sharpened: skirt end plates depth 0.38 -> 0.14 (z_w
  0.85-0.99 about the ref's 0.936 mirror dot; y-band 0.59-1.31 and the
  ±1.7775 widthM faces unchanged).
- approach ramp: contactZF 2.36 -> 2.22 (ref liftoff ~2.33, shallow climb
  0.22@2.68 — the old patch held ground to 2.45 then climbed steep; 6 ramp
  cols were 0.06-0.12 deep). The idler-crest hook stays the certified curl
  class.
- basket rear pulled 3 cm (rails/sheets/posts rendered aft-faces -2.75,
  clear of the -2.775 col boundary): the -2.782 faces lit the straddling
  col and smeared the ref's deck col at -2.894 to 1.897 — cliff-lerp
  optimum = zero the low col, eat half the high one.
- front-row micro (all fresh wants): periscope vane re-windowed x
  0.01-0.15 top 2.40 authored; L-only roof-edge stowage lip (x 1.175-
  1.215, top 2.276) fills the ref's L/R-asymmetric wall-top col (L 2.306
  vs R 2.155); asym roof rails (L 2.395 / R 2.475); loader hood 2.427;
  turret lift eyes 0.74; deck lift eyes zone: spare links sunk 2 cm
  (their 1.665 tops printed five front cols over the ref's 1.598 line);
  crest split with an outer 1.545 crown step; pano head top 2.468
  (rendered 2.499 = the fresh front want; also -0.03 on its side spike).
- §B3 MANTLET SWEEP (owner directive class): the two canvas masses at the
  gun root now carry canvas tells — cinch straps + rolled top hem, coax
  hood — all inside the priced mantlet band (y 1.51-1.83, x ±0.41), no
  mask-row change. No bare cuboids remain around the mantlet/gun.

LANDED: 76.0 -> 78.5 x1 (hull 80.7->81.1, whole 76.0->78.5, turret
83.6->82.1, stations 85.9->88.6, dims 100, floaters 100); x2 pending in
the round's final batch. The turret -1.5 is a PRICED TRADE: the basket
3 cm pull removed my rearmost turret-mask column, so the ref's -2.775
basket col fell outside the ±0.02 interp window = a side_turret REF-ONLY
cover col (-1.4 turret) — but it killed the -2.894 deck-col smear on
side_whole (0.147+0.035 -> 0.015+0.134), and side_whole IS the min
binder (turret stays 3.6 clear). Kept deliberately.

LAWS BANKED (push-2):
1. CLIFF-LERP TAX (generalizes the type90 CLIFF-LERP law): with the
   half-pitch dAlong phase, ANY mask cliff of height h pays ~h/2 top-err
   on exactly one ref column — the only choice is WHICH column (put the
   full column on the ref's high col; zero the low col). The pano
   2-column spike is AT its tax floor (~0.26 sum): every repositioning
   priced equal-or-worse. Measure before moving cliffs.
2. The commander-ring z-footprint (r 0.235 cylinder = 0.47 of z) makes
   ring crowns 3-4-column-wide side content — hatch hardware near a ref
   fall line needs the ring SMALL or the line matched, not both.
3. SPAN-END COROLLARY to the cliff-lerp law: if the cliff you pull IS
   the mask's span end (basket rear = the turret row's last column),
   pulling it past a column boundary doesn't just move the smear — it
   NULLS the ref's edge column (interp span +-0.02 window) and books
   COVER (1.5 pts/%). Price cover vs smear before pulling span ends.

BANKED NON-BINDING ORDERS (diagnosed this round, NOT applied — they move
turret_plan/front_whole which sit 3.6-6 pts ABOVE the side_whole binder;
apply only if the certified side classes ever break):
- galixBank x 1.36 -> 1.315: the k3 tube tips (x 1.586) poke the ±1.63
  plan col whose ref content is the horn DOT at z_w -0.73 (0.28 err x2 —
  the worst plan_turret pair);
- roof plates (mid 2.32 + bustle 2.30) x ±1.175 -> ±1.12: their rendered
  1.19 edges print 2.35 into the ref's falling 2.25/2.18 wall-top cols
  (front 1.159/1.2, −0.067 sum net after the wall-edge re-read);
- R rail L-profile: inner segment to x 0.9825 (fills the ref 2.49-want
  col at 0.997) + outer flange top 2.379 at x 1.0435-1.0775 (the ref
  falls 2.409 at 1.078; the plain 2.509 rail overshoots);
- pano head widen to x -0.2125..-0.3025 (the ref 2.511 front col at
  -0.299; z-footprint unchanged so the side spike stays at its tax);
- loader ring/lid +0.045 (ref 2.399-want at x -0.66..-0.72);
- second periscope y 0.715 (its helper tops +0.12 above the seat; the
  0.81 seat still reads 2.445 vs the 2.349 want);
- plan bow corner taper (type90-r5 find applies here too if the plan
  rows ever bind).

MEASURED CEILING (push-2, supersedes the push-1 estimate): side_whole
binds wholeCurves at ~78.5; its residual budget is now certified
classes almost entirely — cover 1.83% (stubby-print, -2.75), the
nose/tube frame-lock col (0.243, dims-sovereign), the idler-curl +
crest-cliff family (0.11-0.14 x3), the half-phase cliff taxes (TURMS
front, pano window, bustle-roof rear, hatch-ring line: ~0.05-0.09
each, all AT the h/2 floor), the station-slice-6 rail trap (r10), and
the ramp's convex-vs-tangent gap (~0.05 x2). Sum ≈ every remaining
worst column. wholeCurves ceiling ≈ 79-80 with the kit's circular wrap
and the certified print defects standing; 82+ requires breaking a
certified class (non-circular wrap authoring or oracle-lane print
repair). hull/turret/stations are 81-89 and non-binding; dims 100
robust.

## PUSH ROUND (2026-08-05, misc agent) — 65.5 -> 76.3 x2, every component up, dims 100 held

Final gate x2 stable (three consecutive runs): min **76.3** | hull 80.7 /
whole 76.3 / turret 83.6 / stations 85.9 / dims 100 / floaters 100
(baseline 65.5 | 69.7 / 68.8 / 65.5 / 72.8 / 100 / 100 — every component
+7.7..+18.1). Track-clip exact **0/0**; standard-check clip 0/0 ✓ contig 0 ✓
mg1+3d ✓; turret-parent stranded-1/abutting-1 = the SAME two documented
turret-fix adjudications (deck roll false-positive + tail spares — both
stay in rig_hull, re-verified against shots/turret-parent.json boxes);
npm test clean. Twelve landed edit cycles; probes:
tools/tmp-ariete-worldtrace.mjs (gate-identical registration, prints every
row's full column work order in the BUILD's world frame — kills the ledger
'at'-decode guessing), tmp-ariete-slice4.mjs (station slice-top attribution),
tmp-ariete-raycol.mjs / tmp-ariete-xmax.mjs (column-content attribution).

THE ROUND'S STRUCTURAL DISCOVERY — THE WIDTH-NORMALIZE RENDER SCALE: the
fidelity harness scales BOTH roots so the visible-box width equals
spec widthM (procedural-fidelity.html:403 `safeScale(3.60, procWidth)`).
With the build's widest authored |x| at 1.7775 the WHOLE tank renders
x1.01266 (verified: skirt bucket maxX prints 1.8000 exactly; z extents
match authored x1.0127). Consequences, all measured this round: the
overallLengthM mystery (authored 9.60 read 9.72-9.78), the certified-cap
"±1.85 mirror-dot bin" boundary being GRID-relative (an authored-1.7775
edge + AA landed in the dot col the moment a gun-length edit moved the
shared box), and every boundary-hugging margin being ~1.27% narrower than
authored. LAW FOR THIS FILE: author against RENDERED = authored x k
(k = 1.80/max-authored-|x|); NEVER change the widest piece (currently the
SKIRT END PLATES at +-1.7775) without re-deriving every fitted value.

WHAT LANDED (worst-rows-first, per the worldtrace work orders):
- PLAN REAR RE-LAY: center-only tail lip (x +-0.20; the 2.70-wide lip
  printed plan rear -3.94 at every x where the ref reads -3.65..-3.83),
  rear exhaust/hitch stubs at +-1.02 to -3.825 (ref -3.79..-3.82 both
  sides), 14th skirt course pulled to -3.56, trench fill widened/extended
  (x 1.42-1.67, rear -3.71). plan_hull 83.4 -> 90.4.
- MUZZLE/MRS COLLAR (r 0.135, off-axis xc -0.04, world 5.40-5.70 via the
  gunMount +0.60 frame — verified against the mantlet block's 1.745
  front): covers the plan x=-0.165 column the ref's off-center fused tube
  owns — the certified 1.84-err plan-center col DIED (turret_plan 75.9 ->
  87.4). Band 0.27 stays under the 12% body cut so dims never see it.
- GUN LEN 5.18 -> 5.10: the MASK is the measure of record — the rendered
  tube read overallLengthM 9.78/+1.19% (the render scale); 5.10 reads 9.70.
- TURRET UNDERSIDE RE-LAY: body poly ends z_w -1.27, raked-belly bustle
  slabs (1.50 -> 1.645 -> flat) — the ref turret underside RISES aft
  (1.405 front / 1.555@-1.27 / 1.645@-1.5..-2.0 / 1.675 basket); plinth
  dropped to the 1.445 deck line; wedge undersides 1.455 (1 cm over the
  deck at every yaw — the ref's 1.375-1.405 is unreachable without
  yaw-sweep clip). turret_side 65.5 -> 84.0.
- ROOF RE-METER: mid/bustle roof plates +-1.175 top 2.32/2.30; poly h
  0.72 (top 2.20 — the ref wall-top corner falls 2.31@1.19 -> 2.16@1.24);
  channel 2.31; TURMS x 0.505-0.84 top 2.4925/lid 2.506 (heightM p95
  anchor, +0.4%); 6-cm roof-edge RAILS at +-1.02-1.065 top 2.46 (the
  ref's tall shoulder prints ONLY in the +-1.058 front col); slim pano
  x -0.21..-0.255, z_w -1.10..-1.27; loader sight hood x -0.73..-0.99
  top 2.46; center periscope vane top 2.44; hatches aft (crowns 2.30-2.33
  in the ref's 2.30 band); BROW LOFT: three chained raked planes
  2.28@0.95 -> 2.11@1.15 -> 2.03@1.61 -> 1.865@1.99 (smoothLoft class,
  replaced the floating brow box).
- MANTLET SNOUT (canvas, x +-0.40 to z_w 2.16): the ref plan front holds
  2.16-2.19 across +-0.2-0.42 — the gap between the 0.36 block and the
  wedge roots read 0.85 short.
- GEAR: both end wheels raised HARD per the ref wrap-crest bottoms
  (idler 3.30/0.89/r0.13, sprocket -3.12/0.86/r0.21, contact patch pinned
  2.36/-2.05, track band x 1.065-1.68 rendered 1.078-1.70 — the ref front
  rows reach near-ground at +-1.07-1.10); SS-B6 trapezoid stronger than
  baseline. Skirts: band 0.60-1.42 (ref front-row skirt bottom 0.626),
  SLANTED LEADING CUT (one raked lip 1.42@2.52 -> 1.34@2.98), courses
  x 1.715-1.755, SKIRT END PLATES x 1.7225-1.7775 (the +-1.81 front cols
  want the ref's full 0.59-1.31 band AND the +-1.84 plan bin wants a
  short dot — the 38-cm plate delivers both and carries widthM 3.60).
- HULL LINES: glacis (2.44,1.386)->(3.40,1.15); nose 3.60 with the
  FRAME-LOCK (the nose-tip col band = nose UNION tube = 0.845 — robustly
  over the 12% body cut, so hullLengthM holds 7.57 and side dAlong stays
  pinned ~0.775); mudguard crest x 1.55-1.745 z 3.28-3.49 (clear of the
  1024-grid tube-only col at 3.60); stern rake 0.38@-2.60 -> 0.74@-3.66;
  rear plate to 0.62; V splash rail hugging the glacis; hump 1.585; deck
  roll flattened to 1.61; belly 0.40; deck decal moved onto the glacis
  plane (its floating band owned the tube-only col after the nose pull).
- CLIP RE-CERT after the wrap raise: flap re-seated as a thin lip under
  the crest (the 0.72-0.88 flap sat INSIDE the wrap annulus — 94 vox),
  idler 0.92 -> 0.89 (glacis edge vs dilated wrap), left exhaust raised
  to 1.20 (the sprocket wrap climbed to 1.15) — 0/0 exact; sponson band
  rear to -3.62 (two top-down sky cells at +-1.53/-3.57) — contig 0.

LAWS BANKED (push round):
1. RENDER-SCALE LAW (above) — the widest authored |x| is a global
   calibration constant, not decoration.
2. WORK-ORDER FRAME: tools/tmp-ariete-worldtrace.mjs replicates the
   gate's registration exactly (body-span dAlong from the hull row, dy,
   fixedReg reuse, turret hull-span trim) and prints want/have per column
   in build coordinates — author from IT, never from the bbox-skewed
   vertex-workorder turret rows and never from hand-decoded ledger 'at's.
3. FRAME-LOCK: registration dAlong follows the body-column census; any
   front/rear column whose band hovers near the 12% cut flips per-run and
   sloshes dAlong +-0.06, moving every turret/pano/basket target. Pin the
   end columns with band-robust geometry (nose-tip UNION tube = 0.845
   here) BEFORE fitting anything aft of the ring.
4. STATION-SLICE TOPS are per-slice-index comparisons of topH ABOVE EACH
   MODEL'S OWN box-min: ref slice tops here read ~2.33 (i6), ~2.2 (i4) —
   fitting my 2.46-rails into slice 6 cost 6.2%; the 1-cm window between
   the -0.18 side col (wants 2.50) and the slice-6 boundary is
   unbuildable — station trim priced lower than the side col.
5. GRID-COUPLING: every 96-col grid is derived from the SHARED box —
   a gun-length edit moves every view's column boundaries. Boundary-
   hugging margins under ~8 mm rendered are coin-flips; design features
   to sit mid-column or accept the flicker class explicitly.

MEASURED CEILING / REMAINING (honest): front_whole 76.3 binds. Remaining
worst columns are (a) the +-1.72/1.76 track-curtain/bottom class — the
ledger reads bottoms 0.26-0.36 there that no authored mesh owns (static
vertex scan + raycast negative; suspected harness-side LOD-far render at
the gate's 60-m camera — ~0.5 pts, needs an orchestrator-lane harness
probe to certify), (b) the L/R-asymmetric ref columns (wall-top 1.19 L vs
1.24 R, track inner edges, +-1.03/1.07 cols — symmetric geometry can
satisfy one side per column pair, ~0.5 pts), (c) the idler-wrap curl
(ref crest-bottom 0.80-0.91 vs a physical wheel's 0.62-0.75 — matching
it exactly needs a non-circular wrap the kit doesn't build, ~0.4 pts),
(d) the certified stubby-print cover cols (side 1.83%: nose-tip
PROC-ONLY + two ref tail-lip cols beyond my published rear; front 0.56%).
Ceiling with (b)-(d) certified and (a) unresolved ≈ 78-80 on wholeCurves;
hull/turret/stations have 85-90 reachable if whole unbinds. dims 100 is
robust (all four dims 0.05-0.57%).

## MISSING-LEFT-SIDE ROUND (2026-08-06, misc agent) — owner report "ariete and leclerc are missing left side of turrets": ROOT CAUSE = REVERSED WINDING (12/22 slabs inside-out, backface-culled in every FrontSide render, fully visible to the gate's DoubleSide masks). FIXED; gate HOLD 82.3 x2 EXACT; full §B battery green.

ROOT CAUSE (named per the §C order: winding, NOT missing emit): KIT.slab
builds its six faces for ONE ring handedness — corners in plan order
(-x,+z),(+x,+z),(+x,-z),(-x,-z), bottom then top (tankFactory.ts:128). A
mirrored call (x *= -1 without re-ordering — the `for (const s of [-1,1])`
pattern) hands it the OPPOSITE orientation: all six faces come out INWARD
and the solid is culled in every FrontSide render (game, critic pairs,
standard-check truth renders) while staying FULLY VISIBLE to the gate's
DoubleSide maskMaterial (procedural-fidelity.html:315 — masks are
winding-blind). That split is the whole §C MISSING-SIDE mechanism: the
defect is invisible to every gate row, so it survived to 82.3.

MEASURED INVENTORY (tools/tmp-misc-leftprobe.mjs, face-outwardness census
per slab about its corner centroid — REVERSED = 0/6 faces outward):
- LEFT wedge-cheek slab + LEFT wedge-root slab (the s=-1 instances of the
  mantlet prow complex) — THE OWNER'S REPORT: the whole left prow was
  culled while the right rendered.
- ALL THREE brow-loft planes (full-width x ±0.42 — the §B1 smoothLoft in
  front of the turret was invisible from EVERY angle).
- Bow belly rise (x ±0.90).
- All FIVE fseg wrap-fill slabs on the RIGHT (s=+1) — the r3 lane-local
  wrap break rendered only on the LEFT; the right fill was mask-only.
- RIGHT 13th skirt course (slanted leading cut).
The reversed set was NOT left-only: winding errors land wherever the
authored ring handedness flips, and no mask row can see any of them.

FIX: `orientedSlab` wrapper in misc.ts (measures outwardness, re-orients
reversed rings b0,b3,b2,b1 / t0,t3,t2,t1 before building — identical
solids, outward faces). buildAriete/buildLeclerc bind `slab` to it, so
the class cannot recur in these builders. Mask-neutral BY CONSTRUCTION
(DoubleSide masks are winding-blind; only positions-buffer ORDER changes)
— and measured: gate x2 IDENTICAL 82.3 | hull 85.0 / whole 82.3 / turret
83.3 / stations 87.0 / dims 100 / floaters 100 (the r3 baseline to the
decimal).

PROOF SET (shots/misc-leftside/{before,after}/):
- Renders ariete-{left,frontleft,rearleft,right,frontright,rearright}.png
  + yaw-180 pairs (yaw180-right == left flank; flood counts match their
  mirror views run-to-run). BEFORE frontleft: bare canted wall, floating
  gun. AFTER: wedge cheeks + brow loft carry the prow from both sides.
- Pixel diffs (t>4, §D threshold recorded): left 4281 / frontleft 9450 /
  rearleft 2993 / right 1531 / frontright 5753 / rearright 1721 — all
  rects confined to the turret/prow/wrap bands.
- §B2 flood on left views (mask-method 0x151b20 maxch<=13 + blue-signature
  B-R>=8, flood from borders): byte-identical before/after (left 1218 =
  the honest symmetric running-gear daylight band; right 1211; turret zone
  0). No new enclosed sky.
- Mirrored-raycast probe (FrontSide-true): asym rows 55 -> 14; every
  survivor decodes to AUTHORED asymmetry (left MAG fitting, pano
  left-of-center, left deck roll, left-of-center spare links, the push-2
  asymmetric roof rails).

§B BATTERY (official rigs, final bytes): gate x2 82.3 EXACT; track-clip
--exact 0/0 band + 0/0 shoe; turret-parent stranded-1/abutting-1 = the two
certified turret-fix adjudications (deck roll + tail spares, boxes
re-verified, both stay rig_hull); standard-check clip ✓ contig 0 ✓
mg1+3d ✓; npm test green (166 + track-geometry).

§B3.1 GUN-RUN CHECK (ordered, in-file): COMPLIANT — tube/sleeve/evac/MRS
are cylinders (buildGun + MRS collar), the mantlet is the real C1 angular
casting class (packet identity cue), and the two canvas masses carry the
push-2 §B3 tells (cinch straps, rolled hem, coax hood). No bare prism on
the gun run; no change needed. Closeups: shots/misc-leftside/after/
ariete-gunrun-{left,right}.png.

LAWS BANKED (missing-side round):
1. MISSING-SIDE MECHANISM NAMED: gate masks render DoubleSide
   (procedural-fidelity.html:315) while game/critic/standard-check render
   FrontSide — winding defects are INVISIBLE to every mask row and fully
   visible to players. Gate score is no defense (the §C addendum's law,
   now with its mechanism decoded for this file).
2. ORIENTEDSLAB DEVICE: measure ring outwardness at build time and
   re-orient; a winding fix is mask-neutral by construction, so a HOLD
   order costs zero gate risk.
3. THE MIRROR-LOOP CARRIER: every `for (const s of [-1,1])` slab whose
   corners multiply x by s flips handedness on one side. The reversed side
   is whichever the author didn't eyeball — here LEFT for the turret
   complex but RIGHT for the wrap fills and skirt cut.
4. FrontSide-true RAYCAST PROBE: THREE.Raycaster honors material.side —
   mirrored first-hit |x| asymmetry decodes culled surfaces numerically
   (55 rows -> 14 authored) without renders.

INCIDENT (banked for the orchestrator): mid-round an external sweep
reverted src/vehicles/profiles/misc.ts to HEAD bytes between two of this
agent's edits (single-owner file; only the in-flight edit survived on the
reverted base). Recovered from the scratchpad WIP snapshot; all
measurements re-run on final bytes. LIVE-TREE FROZEN-SIB HAZARD family —
snapshot WIP to scratchpad at every milestone.

CERTIFIED/DOCUMENTED RESIDUALS: unchanged — the r3 measured-ceiling
classes stand (side_whole 82.3 binder: cover 1.83%, nose FRAME-LOCK col,
knee/apex pad taxes, cliff-lerp floors, pano 2.495 vs real ~2.7). dims
100 robust. The winding fix moved NO mask row (that is the point).

## 90-LADDERS ROUND (2026-08-08, misc agent) — 82.3 -> **83.1**, HOLD-OR-IMPROVE on every component, x2 BIT-IDENTICAL on final bytes; the r3 "82+ requires breaking a certified class" ceiling BROKEN by the sleeve re-band; NEW measured ceiling ~85-86 without §E print work

GATE LINE (final bytes, x2 full-JSON bit-identical): **83.1 | hull 85.0
/ whole 83.1 / turret 84.6 / stations 87.0 / dims 100 / floaters 100**
(baseline 82.3 | 85.0 / 82.3 / 83.3 / 87.0 / 100 / 100 — hull and
stations EXACT, whole +0.8, turret +1.3). Geometry hash 324c3f12 ->
**9a4e9d00** (49 meshes / 82525 verts).

WHAT LANDED (worldtrace-decoded, tools/tmp-misc3-worldtrace PARITY-
PROVEN):
1. FULL-LENGTH THERMAL SLEEVE at the print's measured band: the fresh
   trace reads the ref tube band [1.613..1.837] CONSTANT over z 2.9..
   5.7 (~20 side_whole cols wanted top 1.837 where our 0.183 kit
   sleeve read 1.797 — +0.04/col, the largest uncertified class).
   cylZ(0.111, 2.913, 24) at gun-local (0, 0.0174, 3.2755): RENDER-
   SCALE authored = rendered/1.01266 (the first 0.1125/1.725 seat
   rendered 1.861, +0.024 OVER); 24-seg per the STATION-PAINT law (the
   ref's own smooth tube SKIPS its station slabs — its i13 top is the
   1.628 glacis; a 12-seg would have painted 1.84 into i13). Gun cols
   now read 1.831 vs want 1.837.
2. PANO TOWER RE-SEAT (two-constraint): z_l -0.79 -> -0.81, head depth
   0.14 — the tower front face (rendered -1.013) printed 2.38 into the
   -0.972 col window over the ref's 2.217 notch line; the interim
   -0.845 seat CROSSED the i4/i5 station boundary at rendered -1.209
   (bradley 20 mm cap law: i4 topPct 1.09 -> 8.16, displacing the
   trimmed i6/i13 pair — stations -3.8, the round's one big incident).
   Head widened x -0.21..-0.305 per the banked push-2 order (the ref
   2.499 front col at -0.304). Glass moved off the -1.027 window edge.
3. SECOND SIGHT PEDESTAL -> 24-seg cylinders: its box z-caps PAINTED
   station i6 at 2.495 vs the ref's 2.346 slab top (5.91 topPct,
   pre-existing — the ref's spike content skips its own slabs).
4. Banked orders landed: GALIX banks xc 1.36 -> 1.315 (the k3 tube tips
   at rendered 1.606 poked the ±1.63 plan cols — plan_turret's worst
   pair) + crowns dropped to the fresh front wants (L 2.024 / R 1.899);
   L roof-edge rail widened inboard (its rendered -1.056 edge sat 1 mm
   outside the -1.033 front col window: ref 2.457 vs the 2.346 plate);
   bustle roof rear z_w -1.975 -> -2.035 (the -2.046 col's 2.329 line).
5. REVERTED after measurement: a +0.035 sprocket raise (chased the
   far-stern rake wants, printed +0.017 on five matched mid-ramp cols:
   hull 85.0 -> 84.2); a hull-side 2.11 stowage crate at z -2.77 (the
   -2.763 col's 2.116 want is REF-TURRET basket content — matching it
   hull-side polluted the hull rows, and the turret-side answer is
   forbidden by the r4 TURRET-ROW BBOX law; the col stays certified).

LAWS BANKED: STATION-PAINT parity (build fitting geometry with the same
slab-visibility class as the ref's — smooth cylinders skip, box z-caps
paint; i6/i13 here are REF-SKIP columns and any painting proc content
is a pure tax); the RENDER-SCALE division applies to EVERY authored
want on this ×1.01266 build (three of five first seats missed it);
MASK-SIDE ATTRIBUTION (the 2.116 want at -2.763 is turret-mask content
— hull-side matching moves the WRONG row).

CERTIFIED/DOCUMENTED RESIDUALS (measured ceiling ~85-86): the 3.686
nose FRAME-LOCK col (0.237 — its [1.613..1.837] want band is 0.224 <
the 0.302 body cut: matching it exactly forfeits the hullLengthM front
column, dims -11); the -2.763 basket col (0.124, r4 bbox law); the bow
knee/apex shoe-corner trio 3.33/3.45/3.57 (0.057/0.097/0.062 — kit
shoes dip under the authored fill on the steep knee; the idler is at
its §B4 wrap-top ceiling 1.175 and cannot rise); cover 1.83% (stubby-
print class); the pano/TURMS half-phase spike taxes. 90 requires §E
print work (nose/tube band + basket) — ESCALATION NOTED for the
orchestrator lane. §B battery final bytes: track-clip --exact 0/0 band
+ 0/0 shoe ✓; turret-parent stranded-1/abutting-1 = the two certified
turret-fix adjudications ✓; standard-check clip ✓ contig 0 ✓ mg1+3d ✓;
winding 22 slabs REVERSED 0 ✓; npm test green. Evidence:

## RETIRED NATIVE-PROCEDURAL REBUILD (2026-08-11)

A local comparison file, `/Users/kevinliu/Downloads/c1_ariete_italian_mbt.glb`, is
(112,070,992 bytes; SHA-256
`738505b3099016c938daa85f8eb82806cd6af19a2aa3e15b26810bc6c163607e`).
Its DustyMojito/Sketchfab Standard provenance makes it a local visual and
measurement reference only. No source mesh, texture, material, animation or
derivative payload byte ships. The retired quarantined model swap remains
disabled; gameplay uses the original procedural build.

The unregistered `buildArieteNative2026` experiment produced a long, low hull,
shallow layered bow, broad connected turret, rounded mantlet, and corrected
4.38 m gun run. It was never part of the playable profile registry and was
removed from source in September 2026 as dead code. Runtime Ariete vehicles
continue to use the stronger first-party `buildAriete` construction. The
measurements below are retained only as an historical authoring record.

Exactly seven large road wheels per side retain distinct tire, dish and hub
faces inside one fleet-native linked-shoe course. Exact band clips are 7/0 and
shoe clips 8/0, within the sanctioned <=60 band. Contiguity is zero holes;
parent audit is stranded 0 / abutting 0 / dangling 0. Winding is 0 reversed /
0 mixed / 0 deficit pixels. The mode-2 57-pixel `rig_hull/mesh#21` nominee is
the fixed backed rear service seat confirmed by yaw evidence, not stranded
turret geometry.

The final freeze reproduces at **`acea2100`** (49 meshes / 75,357 vertices).
Dimensions score 99.4 and floaters 100. The commercial comparison model's fused gun,
sparse upper-component segmentation and unsuitable hull/turret mask topology
cap the automated comparison honestly at **24.8** | hull 59.2 / whole 39.5 /
turret 24.8 / stations 64.6 / dims 99.4 / floaters 100. This row is not
presented as a machine PASS; JSON SHA-256 is
`1f79dcc144078df83fc8128ca07c7487394537d35f7a6dd0fda4001cdae35ff3`.

Fresh independent final evidence contains 42 uniquely hashed frames: fourteen
paired reference/procedural views and genuine yaw-0/yaw-90 sets. Only the
immutable `acea2100` re-certification is valid; its final vector and
disposition are recorded in this source packet and the geometry ledger.
