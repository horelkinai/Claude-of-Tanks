# kf51b — KF51B Panther (owner-source rebuild, fleet-integrated) — photo-class packet

## Class: FALSE-0 / photo-class — NEVER GATE
No usable oracle: the owner FBX drop that seeded buildKF51OwnerExact is an
external comparison source only (baked-shading demonstrator read); the id
carries no geometry-gate row by law (FALSE-0). Evidence class is §5.254
pixel pairs + structural audits, exactly like leo1a5.

## Turret crown, forward seat, and roof weapon revision (2026-08-30)

The `kf51b-turret-forward-convex-r1` revision moves the complete articulated
turret farther forward and removes the apparent cavity in its roof:

- The ring moves from local z 0.42 to 0.65 before the vehicle's 1.05x install
  scale, producing installed z 0.6825. The gun, roof equipment, cage, sensors,
  and weapon station remain children of the same turret rig.
- The cavity was authored geometry, not a normals or shader defect. The old
  top fan connected two 0.27 m front edge stations directly to a 0.58 m
  center and formed a broad triangular valley. The rebuilt perimeter rises
  through 0.48–0.63 m to a 0.66 m crown, so every roof fan face slopes upward
  rather than folding inward.
- The retired thin-post split shield is replaced by the Leopard 2A6M shared
  powered open-yoke tower at the same reduced-tower scale and riser height.
  Its `kf51b-panther` variant adds twin EO apertures, a low arrow brow,
  canted armored cheeks, and visible feed hardware while retaining the
  KF51B palette and turret ownership.
- The authoritative turret pivot, gun pivot, tube length, and bore radius now
  use the final installed frame: `[0, 1.806, 0.6825]`,
  `[0, 0.231, 1.659]`, 5.565 m, and 0.0672 m. The simulated muzzle at z
  7.9065 therefore coincides with the rendered muzzle instead of lagging it
  by 0.8265 m.

`kf51bTurretCenter.selftest.mjs` locks the convex crown, installed combat
frame, forward ring seat, turret ownership, and KF51B open-yoke variant.

## Proportion and protection revision (2026-08-30)
Owner-directed `kf51b-proportions-armor-r1` replaces the earlier presentation
frame while retaining the clean-room KF51B identity described below:

- The complete articulated vehicle hierarchy is uniformly 1.05x larger. The
  turret pivot, movement contact envelope and track hit geometry are scaled
  with the visible model; this is not a render-only transform.
- The earlier proportion pass moved the turret ring from local z 0.30 to
  0.42 (installed z 0.441). The newer turret revision above supersedes that
  intermediate seat with local z 0.65 / installed z 0.6825.
- Seven road wheels per side use a local 0.355 m radius at y 0.395, preserving
  the former 0.040 m authored ground clearance. Their cadence moves 0.12 m
  forward, from z 2.72 through -2.18. Return rollers move 0.10 m forward and
  the existing high-resolution, deduplicated 0.105 m track course is rebuilt
  from those revised seats.
- The thin two-band skirts are retired in favor of seven broad carrier-backed
  external-armor modules per side. Each module has two layered protection
  faces; the course spans local y 0.62–1.45 and reaches local x ±1.904. It is
  registered as static visual external armor, preserving base hull-envelope
  semantics and adding no per-frame work.
- The KF51B grille language remains, but the rails are reseated to the upper
  service band at local y 1.38–1.54 and x ±1.929. Hangers, joints and the
  armored leading shoulder were rebuilt around the thicker course so the
  grilles no longer mask or intersect the wheels.

Regression receipt: `kf51bTurretCenter.selftest.mjs` locks the installed scale,
turret shift, wheel radius/cadence, track course, skirt semantics and grille
seat. Historical dimensions and skirt statements later in this packet describe
the earlier evidence frames, not this owner-directed proportion revision.

## §5.303 OWNER ORDER (verbatim, 2026-08-17; lane E item 3, §5.311 recovery)
"lets integrate kf51 b. make it a lot more inline with our visual
aesthetic and tracks and hull and turret."
Baseline: buildKF51OwnerExact at 94a83234-era HEAD (owner-exact FBX read:
kf51-source-facets shader grade, 96%-naked disc row, source-matched
near-black gear tones). Resident guard: kf51 `ffb1144c` UNTOUCHABLE
(held EXACT through the whole lane — hash proof below).

## Integration receipts (tracks / hull / turret — the order's three nouns)
1. TRACKS (§B6 + §5.262): the course was already the real §B6
   suspension-driven smart course (linkPitchM 0.105, gearFloor). The
   source-matched near-black tire/wheel hexes collapsed the seven discs
   into one flat band once the facet grade retired — tireHex 0x1b1c19 →
   fleet hooked-rubber 0x2b2d24 (a4 receipt) + scheme dish restores the
   tire-ringed read (§5.262 gear-contrast law). Fleet weathered rubber
   0x33352b on flaps.
2. HULL: kf51-source-facets shader grade RETIRED (it reproduced the FBX's
   BAKED shading — walls crushed to 19-52% luma, roofs boosted 122%; in
   fleet lighting the sides read near-black with the deck crease floating,
   §5.266-crown class). The build now renders on the fleet camo/CSM/
   ambient stack like every leopard; woodland palette lives in the spec
   visual row (`kf51Specs.ts`). FLEET SKIRT READ replaces the bare
   demonstrator flank: two-band modular course (proud upper band under the
   fender lip + recessed lower panel run to the 0.55 hem, panel joints,
   hangers, chamfered leading block), §B8.1 exposure ~62% of the 0.81 disc
   (family 40-70 band), §B9 lower wheel halves + full course below the
   hem; extremes inside ±1.80. Census kit the demonstrator lacked: driver
   periscope pair, glacis tow cable, pioneer shovel (stern shelf), bow tow
   eyes + shackle bosses, convoy plate, front mudguard assemblies +
   Bundeswehr width rods, rear mudflaps (§B4-clear of both shoe orbits).
3. TURRET: owner b3d15714 deepening ABSORBED VERBATIM (see below). Added
   the photo-class twin rod whips at the bustle corners (base pots + thin
   near-vertical rods, tips ~3.1 world inside the SEOSS/RWS band — no new
   heightM column class; turretG-owned, yaws with the mass).

## §5.311 recovery fixes (structural audits driven to zero)
- §B4 strict-sweep 311/129 → 0/0: the source-read 1.08 mid-run tub
  stations sat 0.112 INSIDE the 0.968 track-band inner face (pre-existing
  in the owner-exact rebuild, exposed by --exact --strict). Wheelbase tub
  stations recede to 0.96 (8 mm clear); the 1.13 sponson floor sat one
  voxel off the band top mid-run and 3.4 cm into the shoe wrap climbing
  the sprocket — deck-loft floor 1.13 → 1.18. Both zones fully covered by
  the §5.299 skirt course on the flanks.
- §B5 stranded 1 → 0: the integration shovel's first seat (-1.28, -1.45)
  sat inside the wedge turret's casting envelope (audit AABB x ±1.55 /
  z ≥ -2.94); re-seated on the flat 1.82 stern shelf fully aft of the
  bustle AABB, outboard of the engine grilles.
- Final battery: track-clip --exact --strict 0/0 front/rear/shoe/sweep;
  turret-parent 0/0/0; duplicate-course PASS (one integrated layer).

## b3d15714 ABSORB STATEMENT (owner deepening, 2026-08-17 07:36)
The owner's "deepen KF51B turret" commit (roof coaming/lid/hinge cadence,
periscope rows, access-panel seams, flush modular flank armor with backed
sensor cells, RWS gun re-cut as a real pintleMG fitting, SEOSS glass)
is carried UNCHANGED through the integration — receipts: sidePanels/
rwsGun blocks verbatim in buildKF51OwnerExact (grep receipts in the lane
report), visible in shots/kf51b-integration/after/close-roof.png and
hero frames. The integration adds AROUND it (whips, census kit, skirts)
and retires only the pre-deepening shader grade + gear hexes.

## Identity vs the kf51 resident (B-variant distinctions)
Both read KF51 Panther (low faceted wedge turret, SEOSS tower, rear-right
RWS, 130 mm class gun). kf51b distinctions: owner-source proportions
(z ±3.84 hull, narrow tub + full-width sponson), an installed-scale Rh-130
frame synchronized to its procedural muzzle, full modular two-band skirts vs the
resident's own course read, woodland 3-tone (#56573e base, number 52,
trackWidthM 0.587), b3d15714 flank-panel/roof-cadence grammar. Resident
kf51 `ffb1144c` byte-held.

## Spec truth-up (`src/vehicles/kf51Specs.ts`, kf51b row only)
Fresh communityArmor instance (kf51's shared armor object untouched):
lenM 7.70 / widM 3.60 / hgtM 2.90, installed turretPivot
[0,1.806,0.6825], installed gunPivot [0,0.231,1.659], barrelLenM 5.565,

## §5.345 DESCENT ORDER — leopard-family rebase (§5.359 clean-room
## completion; 2026-08-17)
Order (owner, verbatim): "completely update our kf51 b to look actually
descended from our leopard family, keeping its general turret shaping but
changing everything else in terms of hull decorations equipment and
cagfes". Built in the PINNED CLEAN WORKTREE wt-5335 @ a7218931 (§5.359
clean-room law). FALSE-0/photo-class respected throughout: kf51b is
NEVER-GATED (no oracle) — ledger absence re-verified at both frames.

### Items (buildKF51OwnerExact, src/vehicles/profiles/leopard.ts)
1. HULL — LEOPARD-DESCENT REBASE: the real KF51 rides a Leopard 2 hull.
   The bespoke demonstrator tub/deck polyMultiLofts, thin fender lips and
   lamp blade are RETIRED; the hull now builds on the FAMILY RIG
   (leoHullV3: one-plane glacis class, leopard deck line + sponson/fender
   run, family driver station, fan wells, leopard rear plate + grilles)
   at the kf51b frame: deck 1.615 crease / 1.64 mid / 1.82 power-pack
   aft; nose 3.84 / tail lip -3.82 / ±1.80 width anchor (spec widM 3.60,
   §5.263). The §5.335-certified turret seat is UNCHANGED (ring 1.72,
   plinth top 1.70). Running gear params VERBATIM from the §5.303 source
   trace (7x0.405 wheels, raised low end wheels, 0.105 fine pitch,
   §5.262 gear-contrast tones) via a NEW leoHullV3 `linkPitchM`
   passthrough (undefined for every other caller — guard hashes prove
   byte-identity). §B4 walls: tub innerW 1.837 (±0.92, 5 cm off the
   0.9685 band inner face), sponson floor 1.19 (return-shoe crest 1.165),
   sponsonLaneLift over the low far-back sprocket wrap, rearWallHW 0.96
   (the a5 wall-in-wrap law — the sprocket wrap reaches z -3.74).
2. TWO-BAND MODULAR SKIRTS at the leopard grammar (§5.324 course upgraded
   to the family read): 7 panels/side — proud upper armored band (1.33)
   with §5.284 face ribs + recessed lower panels to the 0.60 hem (~68% of
   the 0.81 wheel disc below, §B9/§B8.1), panel joints, two-band joint
   shadow, hangers into the fender line (aft 1.545 / fore 1.475 following
   the falling fore-fender), forward-most upper panel TAPERING with the
   fore-fender line, chamfered leading block following it down
   (1.40 -> 1.18). §5.263: widest skirt face 1.7975 < the ±1.80 anchor.
3. GERMAN KIT CENSUS SET (leo1a5/a6m grammar at this frame; deck kit tops
   <= 1.71 under the low turret's sweep plane): fore fender bins + aft
   deck bins (lids, seams, latches), width-indicator rods, headlight
   brush guards riding the glacis plane, bow tow eyes flush on the raked
   beak + shackle pins, rear mudflaps with real hinge arms (§B4: sprocket
   wrap far edge -3.74, flap plane -3.79), front mudguard wing +
   shortened flap + connector strap (floater law: strap underside 1.17
   clears the 1.07 wrap crest) + mudguard well sheet over the idler (§B2:
   the strap<->wrap corridor read as enclosed cells; the real fender
   sheet covers the well), rear outboard service faces (dark panel + rib
   ladder + guarded tail-lamp pod per side — the leopard rear-plate read
   carried to the sponson tails), stern shackle bows, Bosch horn, glacis
   tow cable V + spare-track-links fitting, pioneer kit on the aft shelf
   (shovel at the §5.311 §B5 seat + axe + crowbar), convoy plate on the
   tail lip, stern jerry can pair.
4. ISAF-CLASS CAGE ACCENTS (order noun 3 "cagfes"; balanced per the a6m
   gestalt findings — accents on the tank, never a frame around it):
   hull run via leoSlatRun with the rail outer face ±1.80 EXACT (= the
   width anchor, §5.263) below the deck line; turret bustle cage — two
   sections per flank + rear panel with drop brackets into the -2.975
   stern plate, all turret-owned (§B5, yaws with the mass), rails
   standing 2-4 cm off the b3d15714 sidePanels faces with dark brackets
   bridging (the §5.335 flank-panel grammar untouched underneath).
5. TURRET SHAPING KEPT (the order's constraint): the §5.335 wedge loft,
   SEOSS, RWS and mast set carry unchanged; whip antennas re-rooted on
   the bustle flanks.
6. COMPLETION FIX (§B5 receipt): the new rear bustle cage panel grew the
   turret casting envelope to z -3.042 — the axe helve's -3.01 end grazed
   it by 3.2 cm (hullWood bucket ABUTTING). Axe pair slid aft 6 cm; every
   wood part now ends <= -3.07 (the a4m stern-shelf class).

### Audits + hashes (§5.359 completion — verified at BOTH frames)
FALSE-0: NEVER-GATED (ledger absence verified in the pinned worktree and
at the merged main frame). track-clip --exact --strict (the canonical
criterion, §5.335 packet convention): **0 front / 0 rear / 0 shoe /
sweep 0/0** at both frames. NOTE for future auditors: the DEFAULT
(dilated, non-strict) mode reads front band 162 on this id — that is the
legacy lane-local mode auditing `gearEndWheelBody` (the idler barrel
inside its own band wrap, a merged both-sides mesh whose x-reach crosses
0 and defeats the legacy skip); under strict, buildRunningGear-tagged
meshes are correctly excluded as the track itself. Attribution receipts:
tri-pinpoint probe (tools/tmp-kf51b-tripin.*, scratch) resolved the 162
to idler-barrel triangles at x 1.09..1.44, y 0.61..0.76 — no hull plate
involved. turret-parent: **0 stranded / 0 dangling**; 1 ABUTTING remains
= the audit's documented review-tier proximity class (GAP 0.12 in plan)
on the hullWood deck tools — kf51b is the low-ring false-flag shape
(ring 1.72 vs deck 1.82: stern deck stowage can never pass the check's
ringY-0.10 deck exclusion). Adjudicated on the render per the audit's
own review-tier rule: the axe lies flat ON the stern shelf, ZERO AABB
overlap with the casting envelope after the item-6 slide, never sweeps.
Duplicate-course: single suspension-driven course (leoGear inside
leoHullV3; no static duplicate).
Hashes: b5d8ab4e (§5.335 demonstrator) -> 68e87948 (the §5.359 report's
rebuild, pre-item-6) -> **2b6cc08** (46/89477) at the pinned frame;
**79a0cc0** (47/89477) at the merged main frame — the
+1 mesh is the owner equipment stream's grouping (§5.354 class; nine
family guards byte-identical pristine-vs-merged prove the lane adds
nothing to guards). Family strip: 7 distinct German vehicles —
shots/kf51b-descent/family-strip.png; §5.254 sets
shots/kf51b-descent/{before,after-b1,after-b2,after}/. Merge receipt:
3-way onto main db3b1375 — the 4 buildKF51 + 3 buildLeo2Revolution
addEquipment conversions preserved verbatim; merged md5 10ce81d2.
npm test exit 0 at the merged state. kf51 resident ffb1144c byte-held at
the pinned frame (-> d73007e4 at main = the owner's own addEquipment
lines, not this lane).
