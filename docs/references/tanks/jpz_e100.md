# Jagdpanzer E 100 (`jpz_e100`)

**Exact variant modeled:** the World-of-Tanks-style Jagdpanzer E 100
("Krokodil") — a fan reconstruction of Krupp's 17 cm StuK L/53 assault gun on
the E 100 chassis (project of 1944; only a 1:5 wooden model was ordered).
This is a PAPER/FAKE vehicle: the oracle GLB (WoT-style print) is the
authoritative shape target; book dims below are the chassis program's.

## Corroborated dimensions

| Measure | Value | Sources (2+ independent) |
|---|---|---|
| Hull length (E 100 chassis) | ~8.7 m | tanks-encyclopedia.com/15-17-cm-sturmgeschutz-auf-e100-fahrgestell/; wiki.wargaming.net/en/Tank:G72_JagdPz_E100 |
| Overall length (w/ 17 cm gun) | ~11.1 m | wargaming wiki model; spec sheet 11.1 m |
| Width | ~4.3 m (E 100 with combat tracks + skirts) | tanks-encyclopedia (E 100 4.48 m over skirts); spec 4.3 m |
| Height | ~3.29 m | spec sheet; oracle 3.32 (normalized) |
| Gun | 17 cm StuK/PaK L/53 (~9 m full tube; WoT model shows ~5 m exposed), plain thick muzzle | tanks-encyclopedia fake-tank article; wargaming wiki |
| Running gear | E 100: overlapped wheel stations behind FULL-LENGTH heavy side skirts, drive moved to the REAR on the real chassis | tanks-encyclopedia (CIOS data) |

## Identity cues

- Enormous central casemate: front plate strongly sloped (~30°), sides
  sloped in, flat roof with two hatches + vents; casemate front blends into
  a Maus-like flat 45° glacis.
- Gun: very thick 17 cm tube in a broad saukopf-ish cast collar low on the
  casemate front; stepped sleeve at the root.
- Hull: full-width sponsons over HEAVY slab side skirts covering the top run
  (Maus/E 100 look); flat fore deck ahead of the casemate; tow eyes on the
  vertical bow shelf.
- Running gear: mostly hidden — wheel bottoms + deep skirt; wide tracks.
- Roof/deck: engine deck grilles behind the casemate, jack + stowage on the
  rear deck, spare links on the bow shelf.

## Local GLB oracle notes

Path: `public/models/tanks/community/jagdpanzer_e100_haphazard.glb`
(fixedMount). Width-normalized to 4.3 m: 11.09 m long × 3.32 m tall.
Casemate roof well above the r1 parametric build (2.65 m); baseline proc was
LONGER than the oracle (11.71) — gun must come in. Fused mesh: component
masks N/A. For a paper vehicle the oracle IS the identity target.

## Mismatch log (before → after per fidelity iteration)

| Date | total | minView | whole | tracks | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-30 | 83.3 | 81.6 | 83.8 | 81.4 | baseline (parametric CASEMATE box) |
| 2026-07-30 | 83.4 | 78.4 | 83.9 | 81.4 | bespoke rebuild: Maus-like 46° glacis + long fore deck w/ grilles (front powerpack), REAR-set casemate (roof to z −3.38), saukopf collar on bolted ring (sealed), 17 cm tube to the oracle's +6.72 muzzle, heavy slab skirts w/ panel joints, hidden dished gear |

Remaining gap: rear 78.4 — the oracle's rear face is bulkier low (its
casemate rear blends into a fuller tail); front/rear masks trade against
the side views on this print. Paper vehicle: oracle is the identity
target per the packet.

### 2026-08-19 supplied comparison model

The user-supplied `jagdpanzer_e_100_world_of_tanks.glb` was used strictly as
an offline authoring comparison. It is not copied into the repository and is
never loaded by the playable vehicle. The 53-node / 25-mesh source measures
4.48 m wide, 3.40 m tall, and 11.42 m long in its native scene bounds; its
hull-only envelope is approximately 4.48 × 2.99 × 8.75 m. The comparison
confirms the tall rear-set casemate, broad bolted gun-mount frame, convex cast
pot, eight large road-wheel stations per side, deep segmented skirts, and the
long exposed 17 cm barrel as the required identity cues.

The procedural redesign preserves that base envelope (3.48 m travel height
with the low remote station fitted) and adds an explicitly
non-armor modernization kit: close-mounted side/rear slat cages with visible
standoffs, a remote M2 station, paired six-tube smoke banks, panoramic sight,
radio whips, and a physical leafy net suit with gun/hatch service cutouts. The
modern hardware intentionally changes the raw silhouette compared with the
bare source; the comparison board records 92.3 for the running-gear component
and 88.2 overall after the added cage, net, and roof equipment. The stricter
geometry receipt rises from the supplied-model baseline of 83.6 to 85.0, with
the dimension component corrected from 0 to 98.3. These parts
remain outside the vehicle's armor buckets and do not enlarge its combat
hitbox.

Balance was rebuilt around a slow tier-X assault destroyer role: 2,300 HP,
1,500 hp engine, 30/12 km/h limits, a 420 mm mantlet and 360 mm casemate front,
plus a 22.5 s reload on the 1,150-damage APCBC round. Premium APCR trades down
to 1,050 damage for 352 mm penetration, while HE is the situational
1,450-damage option. The resulting sustained damage stays below 3,100 DPM so
the improved armor and handling do not also create a burst-and-DPM outlier.


## Geometry gate v9 (2026-07-31, from-scratch agent)

Two-layer rebuild: piecewise sloped roof (2.76@+0.76 -> 3.30@-3.0), skirts
0.95..1.50 at exactly +-2.15, prow beam + cheeks carrying published
hullLengthM, oracle-fat 17cm tube (r 0.15-0.185). v9: min 31.9 with dims
99.6, stations 68.4, floaters 100; hull=whole 31.9 is front-view-limited
(crown width + skirt band lip) — the cleanest oracle in the family, no cap
needed beyond the +-0.26 m hull-span stretch (oracle body 8.18 vs published
8.7) which costs ~4 end columns and every plan column ~0.25 m.


## Geometry gate v10 round-2 (2026-07-31)
Round-2 row: hull 66.6 whole 66.5 turret 100 (fixedMount) stations 68.6
dims 99.6 floaters 100 (ledger: 31.9/31.9/100/68.4/99.6/100 — front_hull
was the 31.9 floor at mean 5.3%).
Front-view fixes per the differ: the bow rows carried b 0.08-0.14 across
the full 1.60 half-width (the ref's belly line between the tracks is 0.45
— raised, prow narrowed to its ±0.72/±1.05 point); the tail-chamfer rows'
top edge projected a wide diagonal in front view (narrowed to the ref's
(1.02, 3.04)->(1.30, 2.58) corner line); fender lip pulled inboard to
±1.72 (the ref's skirt tops at x 2.0-2.15 are 1.0-1.45).

WORK (probe contracts held: hullLength span 8.7066 -> 8.7248 (+0.28% vs
pub 8.7, in grace; the tail link rack's first cut at z -4.245 printed body
columns to -4.364 / +0.70% and was tucked to -4.205 to weld flush into the
tail face — margin bank receipt), overall 11.266, width 4.32, height-p95
3.2975 EXACT):
- Saukopf dress: bolted collar ring (10 studs), canvas dust-boot ring at
  the pot exit, casting seam. Fore-deck access hatch seam ring.
- The two bow "spare link" plates (owner bare-cuboid class) -> segmented
  spareTrackStrip x3 links each; fore-deck stowage from the fleet
  libraries: 3-can jerry rack + rails + hold-down strap (tops under the
  17cm tube line — zero side-column cost by construction), tarp roll,
  shovel + axe, second Bosch light + signal horn, bow shackle rings + pins
  on the cheek bumps.
- §B3 MANDATE: MG34 pintle on the FORWARD roof slope (top 3.22 < the 3.30
  crest — no topMax/rough shift; hull buckets).
- Roof: hatch seam rings on both domes, vent base collars, periscope
  collars.
- Rear: port-side tow cable run (starboard existed), tail shackle rings +
  pins, vertical 2-link rack welded on the tail wall, jack + block kept.
- Skirts: 7 hanger outriggers per side welded skirt-top->wall (y 1.455,
  grep-verified 2 lines after the perl weld — the marker law).

RESIDUALS: overall reads 11.266 vs pub 11.1 (+1.5%) in the OWN-frame probe
— the same read as the pre-round baseline (the muzzle sits at the v10
station; the gate's shared-frame read was 99.6-class); live rows pending
the registration fix.
