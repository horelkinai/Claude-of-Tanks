# K2B (`k2b`) — §5.299 resurrection packet

**Owner order (§5.299, verbatim):** "make our old pl-01 from before our
changes into a new K2B tank in korea"

**What this id is:** the pre-§5.248-wave PL-01 build — the K2-donor stealth
variant that shipped before the poland ground-up wave — resurrected as a NEW
Korean fleet id. It is NOT a new design round: geometry, spec deltas and the
marking seat are the old pl01's, re-flagged K2B / South Korea. The current
`pl01` (§5.267 ratified ground-up stealth build, hashgeo `d168fac4`) is
untouched and remains Poland's; this id coexists beside it.

## PROVENANCE / DONOR LINEAGE

- Source of truth (builder): `git show d7ba844f^:src/vehicles/profiles/poland.js`
  — `buildPL01(P) { buildK2(P); addPL01Package(P); }` plus the module helpers
  it used (`mount`, `cassette`, `addPolishWhips`, `addPolishRWS`).
- Source of truth (spec row): `git show d7ba844f^:src/vehicles/poland.js`
  — `pl01: variant('pl01', 'k2', {…})`.
- Donor: `k2` (buildK2 + spec, `src/vehicles/modern3.ts`). Donor drift check:
  buildK2 function body and the k2 spec row are **byte-identical** between
  `d7ba844f` (old pl01's last certified tree) and HEAD (diff receipts run
  2026-08-17), so the resurrection reproduces the certified geometry exactly.
- New home: `src/vehicles/profiles/korea.js` (`buildK2B` = verbatim old
  package; helpers `addPolishWhips`/`addPolishRWS` carried verbatim, renamed
  `addRoofWhips`/`addRoofRWS`) + `src/vehicles/korea.ts` (typed old
  variant machinery, nation `'South Korea'` — the donor's own nation string,
  one garage tab with k2/k1a1).
- Intentional deltas vs the old pl01 (identity only, zero geometry):
  1. baked hull number decal text `'PL-01'` → `'K2B'` (texture paint on the
     same quad — geometry-neutral, proven by the hash receipt below);
  2. spec identity: id `k2b`, name/number/displayName/shortName `K2B`,
     nation `South Korea`;
  3. tier IX (= k2's tier row).
- Everything else is the old row verbatim: digital scheme
  (#313b38/#47504a + patches, camoScale 0.36), dims 7.00/9.20/3.80/2.80,
  hp 2300, 1000 hp, 35.0 t, 70/30 km/h, traverse 44, pitch 36, reload 5.4 s,
  first shell renamed `DM63A1 APFSDS`, armorFactor 1.10 on the cloned k2
  plates. Donor rig (turretPivot/gunPivot/gunBarrel) = certified k2 clone,
  exactly as the old row inherited it.

## HASH RECEIPTS (tools/tmp-hashgeo.mjs, camoSeed 4242)

| id | hash | meshes | verts | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **k2b** (this build, HEAD+wiring) | **13afe560** | 76 | 132434 | NEW baseline |
| pl01 @ d7ba844f^ (the resurrected source, worktree run) | 13afe560 | 76 | 132434 | **byte-identical** to k2b |
| pl01 (current, untouchable) | d168fac4 | 53 | 67259 | UNMOVED — hard gate pass |
| k2 (donor guard) | 99594568 | 63 | 117370 | UNMOVED — donor guard pass |

The k2b ≡ old-pl01 hash identity is the resurrection proof: the only
authored delta (decal text) lives in texture paint, not geometry.

## ORACLE STATE

**NO reference oracle.** MODEL_SOURCE procedural, **no geometry-gate row**
(§5.299 order: FALSE-0/photo-class law — never gate this id, and never wrap
k2's oracle onto it). Bar for future fidelity rounds = photo class.

## WIRING CHECKLIST (§5.287 — every touched file)

1. `src/vehicles/profiles/korea.js` — NEW: buildK2B (resurrected geometry),
   KOREA_PROFILES export.
2. `src/vehicles/korea.ts` — KOREA_IDS/KOREA_SPECS (typed variant
   machinery, South Korea), TANK_SPECS/MODEL_SOURCE/ALL_TANK_IDS
   registration.
3. `src/vehicles/tankFactory.ts` — `import './korea.ts';` (after poland.ts,
   before finalizeFirstPartyRoster, so the K2 donor rig exists first).
4. `src/vehicles/profiledProcedurals.ts` — KOREA_PROFILES import + spread
   into PROCEDURAL_PROFILES (builder reaches BUILDERS via the standard
   profile merge).
5. `src/vehicles/tier.ts` — `k2b: 9` (k2's tier).
6. `src/vehicles/tankLabels.ts` — LABEL_OVERRIDES row (displayName/shortName
   `K2B`, aliases `K2B Black Panther`, `Korean stealth K2`).
7. `src/vehicles/vehicleMarkings.ts` — `k2b: anchor('hull','left',0.44,
   0.61,0.26,1)` (the old pl01's proven seat on the faceted hull-side
   panels — same geometry).

## VERIFICATION (2026-08-17)

- `npm test` **green** at HEAD+this-wiring-only (clean worktree at 6b5b7cf3
  + the 7 files above; the live shared tree carried an unrelated foreign
  mid-edit WIP in profiles/leopard.ts — `frustum` ReferenceError in
  buildLeo2A4M — which fails the suite there independently of this lane).
  tier.selftest 115 tanks (k2b covered), vehicleMarkings.selftest 115
  anchors (k2b paint raycast seats on real armor), tankAssets.selftest 115
  (metadata + shadow-caster construction for every id incl. k2b),
  garageOrder/flags/matchmaking green.
- Garage receipt: KR tab card `IX K2B`, designation ROK-K2B, South Korea
  flag, BATTLE enabled; stats card shows the old deltas (2300 hp, 70 km/h,
  5.4 s, DM63A1 APFSDS).

## EVIDENCE

`shots/k2b/`: `garage.png` + six angles (`0_front_left`, `1_front_right`,
`2_side_left`, `3_side_right`, `4_rear_left`, `5_top_front`) — captured in
one cot-shots FIFO ticket (tools/tmp-afv-lockrun.mjs → tools/tmp-k2b-shots.mjs
+ tools/tmp-k2b-angles.html) from the clean HEAD+wiring worktree; all seven
frames eyeballed (full framing, K2B hull number legible on the flank panels).

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-17 | — | — | — | — | — | — | resurrection landing; no oracle, no gate row (photo-class law) |
