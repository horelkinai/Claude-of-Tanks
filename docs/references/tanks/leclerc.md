## Identity cues (what makes this vehicle unmistakable)

- Turret plan-form and roof layout: TALL NARROW autoloader turret — vertical
  narrow front face, angled cheek plates sweeping to long parallel slab
  sides, full-height squared bustle housing the autoloader; flat roof with
  ammo resupply panel lines aft; commander's HL-70 armored sight box on the
  roof right of the gun; slim HL-15/FINDERS panoramic periscope MAST
  (thin pedestal, small head) roof left-rear — not a fat tower.
- Mantlet/gun mount: LOW-SEATED gun in a wide shallow mantlet plate with a
  heavy collar; gun axis visibly low against the tall turret face.
- Hull front: compact (shortest modern MBT hull), clean single-plane glacis,
  driver hatch LEFT with 3 episcopes, splash ridge across the plate.
- Running gear + skirts: 6 wheels; front third of the skirts are thick
  armored blocks, rear two-thirds rubber sheet with vertical seams.
- Signature equipment: GALIX 80 mm dischargers splayed on both rear turret
  corners; side stowage baskets along the turret flanks; rear hull stowage
  rack/panniers; crosswind mast + two whip antennas on the bustle.

## Local GLB oracle notes

Path: `public/models/tanks/char_leclerc_andertan.glb` (CC-BY 4.0).
Width-normalized to 3.60: overall 9.80, height 3.07 (over masts). Gun axis
reads ≈ 1.93 m, roof plateau ≈ 2.35–2.40 m (slightly under the published
2.53 — small cap), pano/sight heads to ≈ 2.83 m, masts to ≈ 3.19 m; turret
side baskets widen the cheeks to ≈ 2.9–3.0 m; hull rear carries a stowage
rack overhang at 1.3–1.75 m height reaching the full 6.88 envelope; front
skirt blocks stand slightly narrower at the bottom than the track guards.

## Mismatch log (before → after per fidelity iteration)

| Date | total | minView | hull | turret | gun | tracks | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| 2026-07-30 | 83.0 | 84.8 | 89.6 | 76.4 | 66.1 | 79.8 | r2/r3 final: gun len 6.17 (muzzle tips now register), taller/deeper mantlet plate, rack deepened. CAP: the oracle's hull rig node under-covers its glacis, so part of the procedural bow is scored inside the gun-overhang window — G plateaus mid-60s with the correct L/52 |

## GATE-V10 round-2 notes (2026-07-31)

dims repaired 100 → 86.6 → 99.9 across the round (heightM p95 discipline:
the crosswind mast moved to the print's single tall column at x −1.10,
centre antenna pot + pano head + HL-70 lid held under the 2.55 line, and
the round-1 whip pair stowed — the print carries no spikes at ±0.98).
Curve work applied: tall front skirt blocks (top 1.46, bottoms 0.48-0.90)
with the tracks pulled inboard to the print's ~1.60 outer edge (the old
build's track columns read to the ground at ±1.72-1.80 where the print
shows floating skirts). Standing min 9 (stations) — the remaining stations/
turret work needs the full measured re-lay this round gave a6/a5
(leoHullV3-class): the hull deck/glacis lines and the bustle scallop are
still the round-1 shapes. No caps — the andertan print is honest.

## GATE-V10 round-3 (2026-07-31, partial — dims recovery + flank re-lay)

Round standing: min 8.1 -> **21.9** (hull 45.4 -> 50.6, whole 37 ->
36.8, turret 14.3 -> 21.9, stations 8.1 -> **25.0**, dims **100**,
floaters 100). The kit-native end wheels at the measured ramp positions
first inflated hullLengthM to 7.14 (3.79%, dims 77.7): the pad-wrapped
far edges merged with the skirts in gap-inclusive columns and read as
BODY. Ends held to +-3.36 far edges (sprocket -2.94/1.02/0.27, idler
2.94/0.96/0.26) restore dims 100 — dims is a protected metric on this
tank — and the tightened hull z-range also re-phased the station slice
windows (stations 9 -> 25). The ref's outer ramp columns stay uncovered
(documented dims-sovereign trade, same law as leo2_revolution). Also this round: skirts SEGMENTED (station law),
6-wheel span re-laid to the measured contact patch [1.97, -2.52], pano
mast moved to the measured w -1.18 spike column, rear hull rack held to
the 1.29..1.57 band, bustle basket pulled inside the -2.52w turret
rear, deep mantlet housing to w 1.48 (ref side band 2.24).
Remaining (next round's work order): stations 25 — the turret-band
tops need the full a5 treatment (probe-driven cluster mapping); turret
rows carry ~0.3-0.5 m band errors across the autoloader roof furniture.
dims must be re-checked after any end-wheel retune (the +-3.36/3.40
far-edge guard).

## VERTEX ROUND r1 (2026-08-03, misc agent) — 21.9 -> 58.2 + normalize plan

Extract (`docs/references/vertex/leclerc.json`, REG appended with the lab
registration; the extract's raw-name matcher needed `^Cylinder\.?086$` —
GLTFLoader sanitizes the dot, the offline parser sees the raw name):
bodyH +9.1% / bodyLen -0.6% / hullMask +3.4% / overall -0.8% / width 0%.
The +9.1% p95 height is a 7-COLUMN furniture band only (pano head 2.76 at
world -1.65, TWO mast/whip spike columns at x ±1.0 z -0.93 topping 3.06,
antenna pots 2.76 at x~0); the roof plateau (2.35-2.45) sits UNDER the
published 2.53 — print otherwise honest. **Normalize plan authored**
(tools/vertex-normalize.mjs `leclerc`): tejas-W1b ceiling compress, knee
2.46, band -> 2.50, max 3.065 -> 2.541; z IDENTITY (hullMask +3.4% is the
REAL rear rack overhang, band 1.30-1.47, 12%-filter exempt — verify will
keep flagging hullMask; documented accepted-real-overhang). ORCHESTRATOR
lands the warp; furniture tops in the build already target the POST-WARP
lines (masts 2.54 at ±1.05/-0.93w, pano head 2.50 at -0.55/-1.65w, HL-70
lid 2.50-2.52 at 0.74..1.16w).

Round log (gate v11): 21.9 -> 53.7 -> 56.8/58.2 (dims dip repaired) ->
**58.2** | hull 62.9 / whole 58.2 / turret 62.1 / stations 58.7 / dims
97.3 / floaters 100. What moved it:
- skirts: REF stations carry full 3.60 width ONLY over the front blocks
  (i9-13, world z >~1.15); the rear two-thirds rubber sheet sits INBOARD
  at ±1.70 with a deeper band (0.53..1.51) — stations 25 -> ~64.
- front blocks hang 0.86..1.43 (not 0.48..1.46); fenders split: deck-edge
  plane (1.575, x<=1.70, z -3.42..2.95) + front flares (1.41, x->1.79,
  z 1.28..3.30).
- engine run FLATTENED to top 1.62 (the old raised 1.74 run was a misread;
  ref deck 1.618 across -2.45..-3.0).
- rear: deep body ends z -3.30 (plate face -3.31); the rack overhang is a
  THIN LADDER -3.40..-3.63 — top rail at 1.50 (a 1.29+1.555 rail pair
  spans a 0.30 column band = EXACTLY the 12% side filter, and hullLengthM
  read the rack as body: dims 71.9 incident, repaired to 97.3).
- turret: sloped aft roof (2.40 front -> 2.26 at the bustle end), DEEP
  turret-frame mantlet chin (band 1.26..2.23 to world z 1.57), forward
  cheek WEDGE pair sweeping to z~2.2 over the glacis, low outer applique
  plates (1.2..1.7 band at x->1.65, z 0.17..0.79), bustle tail rises to a
  thin top shelf (2.05..2.21 at -2.3), basket/kit inside world -2.32,
  whips STOWED, roof MG pintle added at the gunner ring (decoration law;
  tops at the 2.54 post-warp mast line — zero net gate cost).
- gear: wheels re-laid to the measured flat patch (centers 1.61..-2.16),
  sprocket -3.06/1.02/0.24; idler HELD at 2.94/0.96/0.26 — the r3 attempt
  to chase the ref's high idler (3.32/1.04/0.23, far edge 3.55) re-ran the
  round-3 dims incident (hullLengthM 7.19): the ±3.36 far-edge guard is
  LAW until the loader gains a wrap-exempt trace.
CERTIFIED-PENDING-WARP residuals (do not chase pre-warp): mast columns
(ref 3.06 vs build 2.54), pano/pot tops (2.76 vs 2.50), sight band, and
the bow nose-tip/idler-ramp ONLY-REF columns (dims-sovereign trade).
Boards: shots/misc-r1/after/leclerc.png (legacy visual 85.2; turret reads
chunky vs the print's slimmer cheeks — critic pass queued post-warp).

## Oracle warp verify note (orchestrator, batch-27)
height -1.4% / overall -0.8% / width 0% — in grace. hullMask +3.4% is the
REAL rear rack overhang (documented pre-warp by the r1 agent): the rack is
hull-node geometry past the hull plate, so the mask window includes it.
Expected flag; not a defect. Builders take hull length from published dims
(7.92 hullLengthM > mask window) per dims sovereignty.

## VERTEX ROUND r2 (2026-08-03, misc agent) — 55.2 -> 85.2+ GEO TARGET MET

Post-warp re-derive from FRESH workorders (r1 hull numbers retired as
instructed). Round log (gate v11): 55.2 -> 68.5 -> 71.9 -> 72 -> 74.1 ->
74.6 -> 83 -> 84.3 -> 84.7 -> 84.9 -> **85.2** (85.3 after the bow
containment restructure) | hull 86.6 / whole 85.3 / turret 87.5 /
stations 89.7 / dims 100 / floaters 100. What the print actually is
(all world-frame, from tools/vertex-workorder.mjs dumps):
- DECK LINE steps: 1.549 fore (-0.28..2.05) / 1.494 dip (-0.50..-0.34) /
  1.577 mid / 1.632 engine (to -3.05) / two 1.715 filler POTS at x ±1.05,
  z -2.27..-2.38 (not a full-width hump) / 1.605 tail lip to -3.28. The
  sponson band tops 1.49 UNDER these (it owned the r1 1.60 line).
- BOW: the raked glacis line IS the silhouette: (1.64,1.55)->(2.66,1.36)
  then TAPERED to x ±0.94 by z 2.78 and a narrow nose to (3.46,1.21) —
  the ascending track band crosses the full-width plane at z>2.75
  (containment law; the print itself interpenetrates there, we cannot).
  Front skirt blocks hang 0.86..1.43 + a SIXTH low block (0.86..1.24,
  z 3.23..3.53, inner face 1.68 CLEAR of the link pads) which is the
  3.497 hullLengthM body-column anchor. Outer mudguard strips x
  1.70..1.785 raked 1.445->1.235 carry the plan's 3.32 outer front.
- HIGH SHORT IDLER (3.16, 1.04, r 0.19, thin band trackTh 0.06): wrap
  top 1.40-1.44 IS the ref's 1.411 bump at z 3.15..3.26; far edge +
  pads 3.51 covers the 3.43..3.54 body columns. Sprocket (-2.86, 1.00,
  0.27): pad far edge -3.27 (pads add ~0.08 past the band — the 6.99
  hullLengthM incident). Wheelbase [-1.92, 2.12] (r1 sat 0.35 aft).
- hullLengthM measures col-center to col-center: body cols must be
  EXACTLY [-3.385, 3.497] for 6.88 — rear plate face at -3.36 (raised
  band 1.245..1.545 + step filler), rack rails 4 SEGMENTS with plan
  gaps at x -0.6/-0.15/+0.62, bags to -3.56 (overall 9.87 with the
  5.90 gun + muzzle drum r 0.146 — a 0.165 drum crossed the 12% side
  filter and hullLengthM swallowed the gun: 9.44 incident).
- TURRET: roof plateau 2.352 to z -1.42 then 0.201-slope to the 2.05..
  2.18 tail shelf; CENTER-RECESSED roof channel (2.248) between raised
  side bands |x| 0.30..1.05 (ref front-view center tops 2.25 vs side
  2.35 — impossible for a flat roof); roof edge chamfers (1.00,2.352)->
  (1.40,2.215); cheek complex: left front ~2.20w flat, right shorter
  with the gunner-sight WELL notch at x 0.55-0.70 (front 1.84w); side
  boxes bottom 1.60w/top chamfer 2.13->1.92w, outer face 1.545-1.555
  (1px off the 1.62 plan column); LOW applique band 1.246..1.60w (left
  z to 1.41w, right to 1.04w — print asym); baskets outer 1.5725 (plan
  x1.62 col sees it, front x1.605 col must NOT); tail: shelf tip right
  -2.17w only to x 0.90 / left -2.33w, center rear NOTCH x 0.0..0.14
  exposing the -1.81w rear face (rails+cage split around it); pano head
  at x ~0.05 z -1.66w top 2.49 (NOT x -0.55; also station-slice i3/i4
  boundary at -1.57w constrains its depth to 0.14); masts L -1.11/R
  +0.99 tops 2.53/2.54; MG receiver 2.40w by the mast (heightM p95
  anchors: sight lid 2.52 x4 cols + masts + pano = p95 2.52).
- GUN: axis 1.85 (r1 1.93 was high), r 0.085, fat junction collars
  0.132/0.126, fore sleeve band 0.138, muzzle drum 0.146 — every gun
  band HELD < 0.296 (the 12% filter).
TRACK CONTAINMENT: exact-audit rear 0 / front 56 -> bow restructure
(glacis taper + outer-strip-only flares + flap below the wrap arc);
gate re-verified 85.3 post-restructure. Boards: shots/misc-r2/.
Residuals if chasing 90: the mirrored one-sided ground columns at
front x ±1.64 (print asymmetry, ~2 cols), plan_whole rack-gap dither,
side_whole 0.56 cover col at the bag tail.

## MISSING-LEFT-SIDE ROUND (2026-08-06, misc agent) — owner report "ariete and leclerc are missing left side of turrets": ROOT CAUSE = REVERSED WINDING (6/21 slabs inside-out — the LEFT forward-cheek complex was a 1.45 m^3 invisible void). FIXED; gate HOLD 85.3 x2 EXACT; §B battery green incl. contig 0 + mg1 (both pre-existing reds repaired); §B3.1 gun-root tells landed at zero gate cost.

ROOT CAUSE (named: winding, NOT missing emit — the geometry was always
authored and always in the masks): same class as ariete this round —
KIT.slab's fixed ring handedness vs mirrored/reordered corner authoring.
Gate masks are DoubleSide (winding-blind); game/critic/standard-check
renders are FrontSide — reversed slabs are player-invisible and
mask-visible, which is how 85.3 carried a missing turret side. Full
mechanism note: ariete packet, missing-side round.

MEASURED INVENTORY (tools/tmp-misc-leftprobe.mjs):
- LEFT forward-cheek near-flat face slab (1.15 m^3!) + LEFT outer sweep
  slab (0.30 m^3) — THE OWNER'S REPORT: the entire left cheek complex
  over the glacis was culled; from the left the turret read as a stub
  with a floating gun (the "surface" a left ray hit at |x|~1.05 was the
  reversed slab's own INNER wall).
- LEFT roof-edge chamfer; LEFT side armor-box chamfer slab.
- RIGHT aft roof wedge; RIGHT outer mudguard strip. (Not left-only —
  handedness flips wherever authoring mirrored without re-ordering.)

FIX + HOLD: `orientedSlab` binding (see ariete packet). Gate x2 IDENTICAL
**85.3 | hull 86.6 / whole 85.3 / turret 87.5 / stations 89.7 / dims 100 /
floaters 100** — the r2 baseline to the decimal.

PROOF SET (shots/misc-leftside/{before,after}/): left/frontleft/rearleft
+ right trio + yaw-180 pairs; BEFORE frontleft shows the cheek void,
AFTER carries the swept cheek mass. Pixel diffs (t>4): left 4921 /
frontleft 10429 / rearleft 4260 / right 1691 / frontright 2923 /
rearright 1556, rects confined to the turret band. §B2 flood on left
views: no new enclosed sky (164 = the honest gear daylight band; turret
zone 0). Raycast asym rows 102 -> 71; survivors are the print's own
authored asymmetries (left-deep GALIX 5x2 + corner bin + left-biased
cage, right sight-well notch at x 0.54-0.70, left-longer cheek/applique
per the print).

§B BATTERY (official rigs, final bytes):
- track-clip --exact: front 24 band / rear 0, shoe 0/0, no blind spot.
  The 24 is PRE-EXISTING AT HEAD (attributed by HEAD-bytes swap run this
  round): a 2 cm sliver of the low bow side wall frustum (x ±1.68 wall,
  y 1.20-1.26 @ z 2.96-2.98) inside the dilated front wrap — under the
  ~60 band bar, visible-shoe layer clean. Documented residual (fixing it
  means moving a priced bow wall under a HOLD order — declined).
- turret-parent: 0/0/0 clean.
- standard-check: **contig 0 ✓ mg1 ✓** — both were PRE-EXISTING REDS at
  HEAD (r2 predates the v2 scan + census), repaired this round:
  (a) CONTIG: two ~6 cm cells per side at (±1.65, z 3.13-3.25) — the
  8 cm fender slot between track plane (1.60) and block/strip lane,
  ringed by pads/block/strip/flap. Closed with `fenderSlotShadowL/R`
  skins = the §C SHADOW-NAMED RENDER FURNITURE mechanism (mask-excluded
  by name — gate rows untouchable by construction; B2 truth scan counts
  them; the game renders the honest fender-slot shadow). x 1.655-1.70 =
  32 mm real clearance off the pad plane: clip audit unchanged at the
  pre-existing 24 (zero new voxels, measured).
  (b) MG CENSUS: the four hand-authored ANF1 pintle pieces migrated to
  FITTINGS.pintleMG (mag class, two-tone, elev 0, foot 0.95/0.578/-0.66)
  + the original sight/mount block kept at x 0.835-0.885 (it carries the
  priced 2.427w line). PRICED-FURNITURE SWAP law banked below: the first
  seat (default elev 0.06, foot 0.615/-0.75) cost stations -1.8 (slice
  i6 barrel line +0.05) and whole -0.1; attribution by disable-run
  (stations recovered exactly with MG off → the fitting, not the §B3.1
  tells), then elev 0 + foot -0.037 reproduced the hand pintle's barrel
  top (2.38w) and receiver band (2.29-2.39w @ z_w -0.85..-0.55) —
  85.3 exact.
  (c) 0d justification (§I): the remaining hand dressing (flank baskets,
  rear cage, rear hull rack, GALIX banks, corner bin) is
  silhouette-STRUCTURAL, gate-matched identity content measured into the
  r2 rows — same justification class as ariete's GALIX/basket note.
- npm test green (166 + track-geometry).

§B3.1 GUN-RUN TELLS (ordered): the fixed tube-root collar + chin stack
read as bare prisms at 1x (closeups: shots/misc-leftside/
gunrun-check/ vs after/). Landed, ALL interior to priced envelopes,
gate-proven zero-cost (85.3 exact with tells in): bolted face frame
plate + circular tube aperture ring on the collar face (z_w ~3.0), root
clamp collar at the collar-chin joint, side flange bolt strips (6.5 mm
proud, y inside the priced 1.70-2.10w band, x inside the ±0.15 plan
cols), dust-boot ring where the tube exits the moving mantlet plate
(r 0.12 < the 0.132 junction collar). The moving mantlet plate itself is
the real Leclerc read (wide shallow plate — identity cue) and the fat
junction collars/sleeve bands are cylinders.

LAWS BANKED:
1. (shared) MISSING-SIDE MECHANISM + ORIENTEDSLAB + MIRROR-LOOP CARRIER +
   FrontSide RAYCAST PROBE — see the ariete packet, this round.
2. PRICED-FURNITURE SWAP LAW (§I corollary): a fittings migration
   replacing HAND-TUNED mask content must reproduce the hand piece's
   mask FOOTPRINT, not just its census — the fitting's elev/foot/z are
   the knobs (elev 0 + sunk foot matched barrel-line and receiver-band
   here; a 3-5 cm barrel-line drift in ONE station slice cost -1.8).
   Attribute with a disable-run BEFORE tuning: it splits fitting cost
   from co-landed edits in one gate run.
3. REVERSED-SLAB INNER-WALL MIRAGE: a culled slab is not a clean void —
   probes/rays see its INTERIOR back-walls (the left cheek "surface" at
   |x|~1.05), which can masquerade as thin misplaced geometry. Trust the
   outwardness census, not the first-hit alone.

CERTIFIED/DOCUMENTED RESIDUALS: the r2 classes stand (mirrored one-sided
ground cols at front ±1.64 print asymmetry, plan_whole rack-gap dither,
side_whole 0.56 cover col at the bag tail); the pre-existing 24-voxel
front band sliver documented above; masts/pano/sight keep heightM p95
(dims 100 robust). Winding fix moved no mask row.

## TURRET-FRONT ROUND (2026-08-06, misc agent) — owner close-up: "the leclerc turret front is more sloped, and slopes down to a small strip of flatness i believe". RE-AUTHORED per §B1: ONE raked plane per cheek down to the narrow near-vertical strip; sight WELL recessed in the RIGHT cheek; §B3.2 density pass. Gate HOLD **85.3 x2 EXACT** (85.3 | hull 86.6 / whole 85.3 / turret 86.8 / stations 88.9 / dims 100 / floaters 100).

PRINT DECODE (tools/tmp-leclercfront-probe.mjs — ref front depth map +
top height map in the gate frame; §D ref-render-outranks-rows): the
andertan print's front is NOT the old build's 0.7 m vertical wall. It is:
cheek planes falling ~18-30 deg-from-horizontal to a NEAR-VERTICAL STRIP
(z_w 2.22-2.23 left / 2.01-2.12 right at y 1.55-1.74, 15 mm base lean);
a center near-vertical plate x -0.25..0.45 (z_w 2.02-2.08, the plan
2.091 line); its 2.243 side shelf z_w 1.4-2.18 carried by the CENTER
housings only (left glass housing top 2.25 + brow 2.13-2.22 + mantlet
rotor) — the print's outboard cheek fields top at just 2.00-2.04w (the
old build ran its 2.24 plateau full-width = the owner's "blocky" read);
gunner-sight bay recessed right of the gun = the plan notch cols 0.623:
1.841 / 0.734: 1.952; a PROUD glass housing on the left cheek (face
1.97-1.99, x -0.35..-0.73) owning the left 2.229 plan band.

NEW ARCHITECTURE (all through orientedSlab; facet quads verified planar,
<= 4 mm sagitta — twisted-quad law):
- CHEEK PLANES: one flat plane per side, 29 deg from horizontal (print
  inboard rake 30.5), from the forward-roof arris (LH 2.352w, z_l 1.06)
  to the strip top (1.74w) on the swept plan line; facet arris at x 0.98
  = the roof-edge chamfer knee; outboard facet top edge runs UNDER the
  chamfer line to (1.38, 0.585, 1.010) — the first draft's (1.44, 0.60)
  rode 11 mm over it and took front cols 1.402-1.524 (+0.09 x3).
- STRIP: y 1.55..1.74w, front 2.06w inboard (plan cols 0.845/0.955 read
  0.003 off the ref's 2.063), swept (0.98, 2.16_l) -> (1.47, 1.731_l):
  plan cols 1.066: 2.035 exact, 1.509: 1.648 exact-R.
- CENTER SPINE: one box x +-0.32 top 2.248w, z_l -0.355..2.245 — owns
  side cols z_w 1.29-2.18 at the ref's 2.243 line ALONE (front z_w 2.145
  = 24 mm inside the col-2.176 window, margin-legal; also fills the old
  z_l 0.395..0.575 center roof slot). Its 2.145 face + visor band read
  +0.054 on plan cols +-0.29 (ref 2.091) — decoded spend.
- SIGHT WELL (right cheek, §B1.1 riding detail): bay cut through plane
  AND strip x 0.50..0.80 — open inboard half to the 1.78w floor (front
  edge 1.84 z_w = plan col 0.623 ref 1.841 EXACT), armored shutter
  housing x 0.68..0.80 face 1.95 z_w (col 0.734 ref 1.952 EXACT), lens +
  frame on the bay rear wall, thin hood riding ON the plane above.
- GUN RUN (§B3.1): strip -> mantlet lower lip (restores the col-2.176
  turret-row bottom 1.55w) -> boot x +-0.19 top 2.13w z_w 2.09-2.62 (ref
  2.132 shelf: cols 2.287/2.398 err 0.031 -> 0.005) -> root collar top
  2.085w z_w 2.60-2.87 (ref 2.077 shelf; rear held 25 mm clear of the
  col-2.951 window — the first draft's 2.90 face lit it +0.027) ->
  thermal-sleeve clamp ring r 0.14 top 1.99w at z_w 2.92 (the honest
  owner of col 2.951's 1.99 line the old collar held by a 4.5 mm AA
  sliver) -> junction collars/sleeve (unchanged). Face frame plate +
  aperture ring moved to the root face (z_w 2.876/2.883); flange strips
  re-seated on boot flanks (+-0.1965) and root (+-0.1765). Old fore
  block + collar box staircase DELETED.
- §B1.1 SYMMETRY: both cheeks carry the same plane/strip/sweep (mean of
  the print's asymmetric L/R sweep lines). The print's proud LEFT glass
  housing is DROPPED per the owner's real-vehicle read (sight = right
  cheek): left plan cols -0.374..-0.928 read 2.063 vs the print's
  2.229/2.201 band (+0.28 err-sum) and stations 10-11 topPct 0.18/0.33
  -> 0.71/0.63 — THE documented symmetry trade, plan_turret 87.47 ->
  86.77 (turret 87.5 -> 86.8) and stations 89.7 -> 88.9. Side-box tops
  stay print-asymmetric (L 0.62 / R 0.53): symmetrizing them cost +0.09
  x3 front cols beyond the chamfer end (gate-in-loop find, reverted).

§B3.2 DENSITY (all mask-decoded, gate-neutral at the hold):
- GALIX right bank 4x1 -> 5+4 double row (real nine-tube fit) INSIDE the
  priced envelope (rear tube z_w -1.76 = documented edge, crown 2.078w).
- Spare track links x4 on the LEFT side-box face (turretTrack steel,
  outer x -1.6035 inside the col -1.592 window; KIT.spareTrackStrip
  cannot mount on a vertical face — its euler stands the 0.5 m plates
  upright, measured +0.17 on front cols; plates authored directly).
- Headlight brush guards capped at y 1.371 (glacis line at z 2.72 is
  1.352: the first 1.445 draft printed +0.07 on two cols; final rails
  1.36 under every row, WIDTH GUARD outer 1.795 < 1.80 after the 1.841
  incident — that first seat rescaled the whole tank: dims 53.6).
- Bow tow shackle pair (clevis + pin nub) on the lower bow x +-0.55,
  proud faces 3.34 < the 3.46 nose / 3.50 pad lanes.
- Second tow cable run on the right engine deck (crown 1.62 < the ref's
  own 1.634 engine line); pioneer tools (shovel + pick) on the INNER
  x 0.90..1.18 deck lanes, crowns 1.62 — the first seat on the 1.60
  outer fender topped front_hull cols 1.44-1.60 by 30 mm (-0.46 row
  pts, gate-in-loop find; front_hull 88.16 vs 88.24 baseline after
  reseat).
- Rear convoy light + guard FLUSH on the rear plate (rear -3.381; the
  35 mm-proud draft moved the col-0.623 rear line +0.083 on plan_whole
  — same col where a 5th rack bag was tried and REVERTED: the print
  deliberately keeps that rail gap open at -3.253, and a stowage()
  entry also shifts the rng stream for every later call, re-jittering
  priced bags. The rack stays four-bag like the ref).
- Cargo straps x4 over the bustle shelf rolls (2.5 mm proud, interior).

GATE LEDGER (rows, before -> after): side_whole 86.17 -> 86.50, side_hull
86.65 EXACT, plan_hull 91.87 -> 91.84, plan_whole 87.90 -> 87.87,
front_hull 88.24 -> 88.16, front_whole 85.25 -> 85.33 (the whole binder,
now ABOVE baseline), side_turret 89.67 -> 89.71, plan_turret 87.47 ->
86.77 (symmetry trade above). Headline 85.3 x2 EXACT on final bytes.

PROOF SET: shots/misc-leclerc-front/{front-before,front-after}/ (24
matched ref/proc views each: quarters, tf-* turret-front closeups, plan,
heroes) + crop-before-*/crop-after-*/crop-ref-* brightened pairs;
left/right + yaw-180 pairs shots/misc-leftside/frontround-after/ (§B2
flood: left 166 = the honest gear band [was 164], turret zone 0, yaw180
pair pixel-consistent).

§B BATTERY (final bytes): track-clip --exact front 24 band / rear 0,
shoe 0/0, no blind spot (the certified pre-existing bow sliver, zero new
voxels); turret-parent 0/0/0; standard-check contig 0 / mg1+0d; npm test
green (166 + track-geometry); tmp-misc-leftprobe REVERSED 0 (27 slabs,
+6 new all outward), asym rows 71 -> 63.

LAWS BANKED (this round):
1. WIDTH-GUARD-BY-DRESSING: a 4 cm decoration post outside the +-1.80
   plane rescales the ENTIRE tank (render-scale law) — dims 100 -> 53.6
   from one brush-guard post at x 1.841. Every §B3.2 piece needs a width
   check before its first gate run.
2. RNG-STREAM STABILITY: adding an entry to an existing stowage() call
   (or any rng consumer) re-jitters every later rng-consuming fitting —
   priced bags move rows. New soft cargo near priced content is authored
   as fixed boxes, or appended at the builder's END.
3. EULER-COMPOSED FITTINGS: KIT helpers with rx/ry-only rotation cannot
   reach every mounting plane (spareTrackStrip on a vertical face stands
   its plates upright). Check the composed box extents against the
   mask BEFORE the gate run, or author plates directly in the helper's
   material.
4. AA-SLIVER OWNERSHIP: a priced col can be held by a sub-pixel face
   kiss (the old collar's 4.5 mm rear sliver read 1.994 at col 2.951).
   Widening the mass re-lights the window (+0.027) — when re-authoring,
   either hold the boundary 25 mm clear AND re-own the line with honest
   geometry (the clamp ring), or accept the col.
5. STATION ROWS SEE THE TURRET: stations 10-11 moved with zero hull
   edits — the 14 station slices price whole-model content in their z
   band; turret-front mass redistribution shows up as station topPct.

HONEST RESIDUALS (this round): turret 86.8 (plan_turret 86.77 — the
+-0.29 spine cols +0.054 and the left 2.063-vs-2.229 band, both the
owner-symmetry read); stations 88.9 (topPct 10-12: 0.71/0.63/0.63 — same
trade + the boot zone); front col 1.398/-1.371 sweep means split the
print's L/R cheek asymmetry (R 0.111 aft / L 0.083 fwd of ref). All
decoded per-column above; headline and every whole/hull row at or above
the 85.3 baseline.

## TURRET PHOTO-PARITY ROUND (2026-08-06, misc agent) — owner, with a Tamiya Leclerc reference photo (front-left 3/4): "fix the leclerc turret, it has to look more like this." Photo class governs the turret region (fv510-r2 precedent flow); gate HOLD 85.3 / dims 100 contract.

### GAP TABLE (photo read -> was @ baseline 85.3 -> fix)
Baseline evidence: fresh gate x1 85.3 exact + full 96-col workorder
(scratchpad wo-leclerc-baseline.txt) + shots/misc-leclerc-front/ boards.
| # | Photo read | Was (measured baseline) | Fix (now) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | TALL rectangular HL-70 panoramic tower center-forward on the roof, big window face, reads above the turret in every view | Squat sightBox + lid (x 0.35..0.75, z_w 0.72..1.24, top 2.52w): reads as a low box; overshoots the ref's own lid line 2.501 x11 front cols (+0.02) and overhangs side col 1.179 (ref 2.381 vs proc 2.52, +0.074) | Proper TOWER at the print's own priced band: pedestal ring + vertical shaft + head block w/ big dark window + wiper + aux scope, x 0.35..0.75, z_w 0.72..1.10, top authored 2.492w (= ref side band); dims heightM p95 hazard measured first: top LOCKED <= 2.50 (published 2.53; masts stay the only >2.53-class spikes). Prominence residual documented (print+dims cap the real ~0.6 m tower) |
| 2 | Turret front = two flat raked cheek plates meeting at a CENTER VERTICAL SEAM, descending to the mantlet zone | Cheek planes exist (29 deg, r2 front round) but the center is a full-width vertical spine face at z_w 2.145 (+0.054 x2 plan cols vs ref 2.091); no seam read | Spine narrowed to a x +-0.115 rotor-brow RIDGE (keeps the priced 2.243 side shelf z_w 1.29..2.18); TWO converging center planes (same 29-deg rake family) x 0.10..0.42/side from the strip to the 2.248 channel line + strip extended inboard — the plane-to-ridge junctions ARE the vertical seam lines; plan cols +-0.29 re-owned by the boot clamp frame at z_w ~2.09 (ref 2.091). Rake angle vs photo verified by evaluator segment read at close |
| 3 | BIG SQUARE CANVAS MANTLET BOOT around the gun root, soft-edged, F1 120mm exiting through it | Hard prism boot x +-0.19 (top 2.13w priced exact); no canvas grammar | Boot widened to x +-0.21 (plan window 0.236 respected, 26 mm clear), top chamfer soft edges, 3 sag-crease dark seams, bolted clamp FRAME at the base (x +-0.26, face z_w ~2.096 — owns plan cols +-0.29 at 0.005 err, better than the old spine +0.054), root collar + §B3.1 thermal-sleeve clamp rings kept + 2 new sleeve-joint rings (r 0.105 < the 1.994 tube line) |
| 4 | Gunner's SAVAN-20 recessed bay right-cheek-top w/ square shuttered window | Built last round; plan cols 0.623/0.734 EXACT (1.841/1.952) | Verify vs photo proportion in 14-view self-reads; shutter slat lines added (2 mm, bay-interior, mask-free) |
| 5 | Pintle MG (7.62 ANF1 'mag') on the LEFT roof edge, forward-left | MG sits RIGHT-rear by the mast (x 0.95, z_w -0.66): side cols -0.593/-0.704 read +0.055/+0.083 over the ref's flat 2.354 roof; ref cols 0.293/0.404 (2.409) UNDERSHOT | MG MOVED to forward-left (x -0.85, z_w ~0.30, foot 0.607, scale 0.78, elev droop): receiver top ~2.43 owns the ref 2.409 pair within the pintle allowance; right sight/mount block stays (priced 2.427 front line, widened to x 0.94 to keep col 0.916 covered after the MG leaves) |
| 6 | LARGE CYLINDRICAL DRUM lying axis-fore-aft on the turret RIGHT REAR | Absent; right-rear plan cols 1.066..1.398 read the turret-box bottom ring/tail-slab overhang +0.11..+0.19 past the ref's swept right rear | Drum r 0.20 x 0.99..1.39, z_w -0.92..-1.66, top 2.16w (side/front-interior by measure) + end caps, rim rings, cradle straps; turret-box right-rear bottom corner tapered to the ref sweep (z_l -1.49), right tail slab outer edge stepped at x 0.96/0.98 (ref's hard step at x ~0.95), GALIX right bank re-seated fwd/inboard — plan_turret rear cols re-owned to the measured ref line |
| 7 | Turret sides flat vertical panels; rear halves boxy stowage bins; clean roof w/ periscope rings + slim mast rear-right | Panels + baskets + left bin exist; cage/cloth reads soft at the right rear; roof periscopes bare; masts priced (L -1.11 / R +0.99 tops 2.53/2.54) | Drum (row 6) + left bin lid seams/latches close the bins read; periscope collar rings added (flush, mask-free); R mast = the photo's rear-right slim mast (kept, priced); commander hatch ring SHAVED to the ref line (proc 2.4 vs ref 2.359 x7 front cols -> ~2.375) |
| 8 | Twin headlight clusters w/ brush guards LOW on the glacis corners + tow shackles | Single lamp per side in guards (y 1.33, z 2.60, guards capped 1.36 per WIDTH-GUARD law); shackles at +-0.55 low bow (r2) | SECOND lamp per cluster added inboard (x +-1.63, same low line, interior to the 1.6 front cols); guards/shackles verified vs photo (placement already low-corner) |

Notch bonus (measured while in-file, funds the round): ref center-rear
NOTCH cols 0.069/-0.042 (+0.222/+0.098 worst plan_turret cols — our roof
channel + aft panel + rib cross the print's notch) — channel split into 4
z-stepped segments (-2.13/-1.99/-1.71/-2.07 z_l rears), panel + rib k3
split around x 0.01..0.135.

### PHOTO ROUND CLOSE-OUT (final bytes; scratchpad misc.ts.final-bores mirror)
Every gap-table fix landed; three were re-derived in-loop against measured
reads (the loop numbers below are the receipts):
- **#1 tower final**: pedestal ring + shaft + head + window apron + big dark
  window + wiper + aux scope (2.42w = ref col 0.795, was undershot) + VISOR
  HOOD (top 2.381w = ref side col 1.179 EXACT — the old lid overhung +0.074,
  the first tower draft undershot -0.069) + lid CAP at 2.52w x4 side cols =
  THE heightM p95 anchor (measured: at head-only 2.492 the p95 fell to 2.48
  and dims dropped 100 -> 92.7 — the 2.52 anchor is the ratified trade,
  +0.02 x11 front / +0.028 x4 side vs the ref's 2.501/2.492 band).
- **#5 MG final**: seat (-0.85, foot 0.640, z_l 0.413), scale 0.78, elev
  -0.18 droop, tone DARK (MG PHYSICS pale-deck polarity; ALSO the measured
  fix — the two-tone pale cap strip rode the barrel to z_w 0.76 at 2.439
  and pixel-printed 2.464 on side cols 0.515/0.626, whatsat-attributed).
  Receiver band now owns the ref's 2.409 side pair (cols 0.293/0.404, were
  undershot -0.019/-0.032). Old right-seat cols -0.593..-1.147 freed (the
  2.437 there is the gunner periscope, baseline-identical). Ammo pouch
  flattened to 2.372w (a 0.045-tall draft re-lit the hatch-shave cols).
- **#6 drum final**: xc 1.24, y c 1.98w (r 0.20, z_w -0.40..-1.12), rim
  rings rx-stood about the drum axis (KIT.torus lies FLAT by default — the
  first draft's unrotated tori read as hula hoops), cradle saddles + 2
  curve-hugging straps (crown x 1.12..1.36, verticals at 1.065/1.40). The
  xc-1.28 outboard try put the flat crown strap at x<=1.485/2.19w and lit
  front cols 1.44/1.48 (+0.14 x2, gate 86.0 -> 85.2) — reverted to 1.24
  where every cylinder chord dives under the chamfer/box lines per column
  window. GALIX bank untouched at its priced seat.
- **Muzzle-bore fold-in (owner order mid-round; §B3.1 addendum 32a6946)**:
  all five misc main guns (leclerc F1 5.88/0.085, ariete 5.08/0.075, t80u
  5.49/0.068, type90 5.59/0.065, type74 5.635/0.062-inside-the-step) carry
  the annular rim + near-black recessed bore disc via a new muzzleBore()
  helper. MECHANISM LAW (measured, banked below): the first bucket-based
  bores grew each gun AABB ~3 cm and RE-FRAMED the turret-rows cameras —
  leclerc turret 88.8 -> 82.6, t80u -4.6, type90 -2.2 with mask-interior
  geometry. The bore is therefore SHADOW-NAMED RENDER FURNITURE
  (muzzleBoreShadowRim dark + muzzleBoreShadowDisc mats.shadow, parented to
  P.gunG): renders in every game/critic view, excluded from every mask AND
  framing recipe by construction — all five ids re-gated BYTE-IDENTICAL to
  their committed ledger lines x2. Evidence: shots/misc-muzzle/
  {bore-before,bore-after}/ end-on + 3/4 crops (the before shows the
  owner's exact complaint: a solid camo cap vanishing against the camo
  hull). leclerc coax + ANF1 MG tips: already law-compliant pinhole-class
  dark tips (all-gunDark stub face / the fitting's 0.55r dark tip disc) —
  documented, no edit.

**GATE (official rig, final bytes, x2 IDENTICAL)**:
**86.0 | hull 86.6 / whole 86.0 / turret 88.8 / stations 90.1 / dims 100 /
floaters 100** — headline +0.7 over the 85.3 HOLD, every component at or
above baseline (turret +2.0, stations +1.2). Row ledger (base -> final):
side_whole 86.50 -> 86.76, front_whole 85.33 -> 86.05, side_turret 89.71 ->
90.10, plan_turret 86.77 -> 88.76 (the notch/tail/seam work: worst col
0.069 +0.222 -> 0.016), side_hull/plan_hull/plan_whole/front_hull EXACT
(hull untouched, byte-stable proof). dims: heightM 2.51 (0.68%), width
3.59, hullLengthM 6.87, overall 9.84. Sibling ids under the shared file
held x2: ariete 82.3, t80u 75.4, type90 83.6, type74 0-capped/99.6 — all
equal to their committed ledger rows.

**§B BATTERY (final bytes)**: track-clip --exact front 24 band / rear 0,
shoe 0/0, no blind spot (the certified pre-existing bow sliver, zero new);
turret-parent 0/0/0 (tower/drum/MG/bores all rotate); standard-check contig
0 + census mg1+0d (the documented silhouette-structural hand-dressing
class) + clip ok; npm test green (166 + track-geometry) x2;
tmp-misc-leftprobe slabs 34 REVERSED 0 mixed 0 (all new center-plane/
channel-segment/chamfer slabs outward through orientedSlab); left/right +
yaw-180 pairs pixel-consistent (flood: left 170 = yaw180-right 170 = the
certified gear-daylight band, turret zone 0, rearright 0).

**visual-evaluator (14 views, official)**: RIG PARITY clean — yawProxy
<= 1.2 deg, no RIG MISMATCH aborts. #2 rake citation: authored cheek plane
29.1 deg from horizontal vs the print's probed 30.5 (Δ1.4 deg, same
class); the one paired angled-edge finding in the cheek band (frontleft:
ref 162.3 vs proc 176.4, ±0.6 noise, 0.43 m edge at the sight-well hood
line) is the §B1.1 well detail riding the plane — documented residual, the
well's plan cols 0.623/0.734 stay EXACT. Evidence: shots/visual-eval-leclerc/.

**14-view self-reads vs the photo class (floor 8.5)**: front 8.8, frontleft
(ACID) 8.8, left 8.7, rearleft 8.6, rear 8.7, rearright 8.8, right 8.7,
frontright 8.8, top 8.7, hero-frontleft 8.9, hero-rearright 8.7,
hero-toptilt 8.7, close-front 8.9, close-roof 8.8 -> floor 8.6. Tells vs
the Tamiya: the tower + window face reads center-forward in every quarter;
the seam brow + converging planes carry the front; the boot reads soft
w/ creases + clamp frame; drum + GALIX own the right rear; MG forward-left;
twin lamp clusters low in the guards. Evidence: shots/critic-leclerc/
(pairs) + shots/misc-leclerc-front/photoround-after/ + shots/misc-leftside/
photoround-final/.

**LAWS BANKED (this round)**:
1. GUN-AABB FRAME LAW (t80u-law corollary, measured): ANY gun-bucket
   content past the tube tip re-frames the turret-rows camera — a 3 cm
   muzzle rim cost leclerc turret -6.2 / t80u -4.6 / type90 -2.2 with
   fully mask-interior geometry. Muzzle furniture that must live past the
   cap goes SHADOW-NAMED on P.gunG (the §C mechanism covers framing, not
   just masks) — proven byte-identical x5 ids x2 runs.
2. HARNESS HIDES SHADOW-NAMED (evidence-tooling corollary): the fidelity
   page parks /shadow/i furniture invisible (baseVisible:429) — evidence
   renderers driving that page must re-show it to depict the game read
   (tmp-misc-muzzle.mjs does); the critic page only excludes it from
   FRAMING (tmp-tank-critic.html:208) and renders it.
3. FITTING-CAP TAIL (priced-furniture-swap corollary): pintleMG 'two-tone'
   rides a pale cap strip down the BARREL (0.8x barrel length) — on a
   flat-roof seat it prints trace-pixel tops ~0.03 over the receiver line
   two columns past the receiver rear. Whatsat the fitting AABB per slot
   before pricing a seat; tone 'dark' drops the strip (and is the MG
   PHYSICS pale-deck answer anyway).
4. KIT.torus LIES FLAT (axis y): rim rings about a z-axis body need
   rx PI/2 (the §B3.1 aperture-ring precedent); flush deck collars need
   NO rotation — the first drum draft had both backwards.
5. LIVE-TREE MID-ROUND LANDINGS (process, for the bank): this round ate
   THREE foreign frame events — gear r8/r8b belly pan (hull rows -31,
   reverted at 15a67ea after owner report), the pan revert restore, and
   rolling roster/spec commits. Baseline x1 at round start + re-baseline
   after any unexplained multi-row move + per-column decode BEFORE
   reverting own work is the survival pattern (the r8b hit was fully
   decoded from the workorder before a single own byte was reverted).

**HONEST RESIDUALS**: the certified r2 classes stand (front ±1.64
one-sided ground cols, plan_whole rack-gap dither, bag-tail cover col);
side_turret worst col is now the lid-cap band itself (err 0.073: the
2.52w p95 anchor over the ref's 2.49->2.38 falloff — the dims-sovereign
trade; the visor hood owns the col-1.179 window at the ref's 2.381);
plan_turret col -0.817..-0.374 band = the owner-symmetry glass-housing
trade (unchanged); col 1.398 rear ~-1.72 vs ref -1.62 (+0.10, GALIX corner
splay — priced §B3.2 content); the tower's real-vehicle ~0.6 m prominence
is capped by the print band + published 2.53 (dims-sovereign, documented);
MG barrel prints ~+0.01-0.02 partial-pixel on side cols 0.515/0.626
(pintle allowance, tone-dark minimized); type74's all-zero curve rows are
its committed certified cap (pre-existing, bores added zero motion).

## FRANCE ROUND (2026-08-07, france agent) — owner §5.14: "update the leclerc. the front sloping was not good, compare the turret to the actual model again to get the geometry much more accurate. also add machine guns and lights and other equipment". RE-MEASURED the print's front; the single 29-deg plane REPLACED by the print's true two-stage profile. Gate **86.2** (baseline 86.0) | hull 86.6 EXACT / whole 86.2 / turret 88.8 / stations 90.3 / dims 100 / floaters 100.

PRINT RE-DECODE (tools/tmp-france-front2.mjs — REF + PROC top/front maps,
the plateau-start question the first probe never covered): the andertan
front is NOT one 29-deg plane to the roof arris. Measured architecture:
- CHEEKS: the 30.5-deg rake is SHORT — strip (y 1.55..1.77) then rake
  rising only to y ~1.96, landing on LOW NEAR-FLAT FIELDS (1.96 -> 2.04w
  over z_w 1.66..1.00, ~7 deg = the actual "long raked face"), then a
  riser at z_w ~1.0 to a 2.21w MID ROOF (the print's left rim/band line),
  and the 2.35 HIGH ROOF only AFT of z_w ~-0.1. The old plane climbing to
  2.352 at z_w 0.96 read +0.06..+0.20 over the ref across the WHOLE cheek
  band (proc-vs-ref maps) — the owner's "not good" decoded.
- CENTER: a TALL near-vertical plate (y 1.65..2.10, face 2.05->2.02, ~8
  deg lean), the NARROW FLAT BROW strip at 2.13w (z_w 1.94..2.03 — "the
  small strip of flatness above the mantlet"), then ONE LONG ~10-deg
  raked face climbing to the 2.248 center line at z_w ~1.26. The photo
  round's V-planes + full-length rotor ridge (2.248 out to z_w 2.145,
  +0.12 over the ref's own 2.13 brow band) are REPLACED by the measured
  plate/brow/slope; the rotor housing bulge (top 2.243, z_w 1.955..2.19)
  + a narrow spine strip on the slope carry the ref's 2.243 side band.
- The 2.352 plateau is NOT full-width forward: ref front center cols read
  2.248-2.278 — the HIGH CAPS are side pieces (x 0.34..1.00/side), the
  center keeps the channel line.
NEW ROOF FURNITURE at print seats: gunner sight HOUSING cluster (base
2.32w + lid step 2.375w, z_w 0.06..0.68 — the ref's own 2.31-2.42 band),
commander hatch WELL (recessed dish floor 2.075w, x -0.35..-0.85, z_w
0.32..0.66 — TRUED UP 2026-08-08 by a 90-ladders triangle-census
measure run (tools/tmp-ladders-whatbox.mjs: cluster X[-0.850,-0.350]
Y[2.068,2.148] Z[0.320,0.660]); the §5.14-era 0.34..0.64 claim was the
interior-opening intent, the world-frame extents run 2 cm wider each
end), tower pedestal dropped to the mid roof
(real ~0.6 m tower prominence restored from BELOW; the 2.52 lid p95
anchor untouched), window apron now reads ~0.44 m tall.

§B3.2 EQUIPMENT (§5.14 order): 12.7 mm M2 pintle (cls m2) right-forward
on the mid roof, FORWARD rest per the §5.07 CROWS-FORWARD law — seat
receipts: first seat cost EXACTLY -0.4 headline by disable-run
attribution (turret -0.7, stations -1.6); re-tuned per the ANF1's own
priced lessons (droop -0.20, ammo can OFF -> flat pouch, scale 0.76,
foot sunk 0.575) to ~0 headline / -0.5 stations — inside the pintle
allowance. Coax port gains its §B3 hood tell. Bow IR/blackout lens caps
on the inboard lamps (flush discs, width-guard safe). LEFT engine-deck
tow-cable run added (pair with the right; crowns 1.61 under the 1.618
line). GALIX banks, baskets, bins, antennas: presence re-verified.

ROW LEDGER (baseline -> final): turret_side 90.10 -> 90.14, turret_plan
88.76 -> 88.76 EXACT, side_whole 86.76 -> 86.79, front_whole 86.05 ->
86.19, plan_whole 87.87 EXACT, side_hull 86.65 EXACT, plan_hull 91.84
EXACT, front_hull 88.16 -> 88.08 (-0.08, IR-cap AA), stations 90.1 ->
90.3, dims/floaters 100 hold. Headline 86.0 -> 86.2.

LOOP RECEIPTS (gate-in-loop finds banked):
1. WINDOW = +-HALF-PITCH: a convex corner sweep chasing raw col reads
   (ref "1.869/1.925 fronts") cost turret 88.8 -> 87.0 — those reads are
   window MAXIMA (+-0.055), not line points; the bulge flooded the
   neighboring priced windows. Author sweeps from POINTWISE map lines,
   never from col extrema. (Reverted; linear sweep stands.)
2. CAP-SEAT PERISCOPES: re-seating roof periscopes onto new roof levels
   must re-derive the HEAD line — the 0.762 cap seat printed +0.10 over
   the ref's 2.36 band (side cols -0.38); flush-sunk seats fixed it and
   the pre-existing 2.55-topping second periscope (+0.19 class) rode the
   same fix (stations 89.3 -> 90.3).
3. MUZZLE-BAND WASH: an on-axis r 0.125 muzzle sleeve matching the ref's
   uniform 1.994..1.744 band scored a WASH (88.7 both seats vs 88.8 with
   the committed drum) — reverted; the drum stays.
HONEST RESIDUALS: plan_turret 1.62 (0.152) / 1.398 (0.125) / 1.288
corner-window class (certified print-corner reads, pre-existing);
the -0.374..-0.817 owner-symmetry glass-housing band (unchanged);
side cols 0.626/-1.147/-0.704 tower-head/block AA class (~0.05);
front_hull -0.08 (IR caps). The M2 stations -0.5 is the documented
pintle-allowance spend.

## 90-LADDERS ROUND (2026-08-08, misc agent) — 86.2 -> **90.3 GATE PASS, every component >= 90**, x2 BIT-IDENTICAL on final bytes (§5.66 acceptance; the <15-load trough never arrived — owner QA fleet held the box at 20-120)

GATE LINE (final bytes, x2 full-JSON bit-identical + 3 more identical
headline runs): **90.3 | hull 92.0 / whole 90.3 / turret 90.5 / stations

(46 meshes / 85165 verts). FLAGGED FOR THE INDEPENDENT CRITIC (>=90).

RUNGS (five batches, all worldtrace-decoded — tools/tmp-misc3-worldtrace
PARITY-PROVEN per batch; attribution via tools/tmp-ladders-whatbox.mjs,
a new triangle+instance-level AABB census probe):
1. GUN PLAN RE-CENTER: the print's fat gun content (drum+sleeve) runs
   OFF-CENTER +0.04 — plan col -0.166 carries NO ref muzzle while
   -0.052..0.171 run to 6.214. Drum + fore sleeve x -> +0.045; collar#2
   TRIMMED to end at world 3.985 and kept centered (the ref's own
   centered fat content ends exactly there); NEW rear thermal-sleeve
   section at the measured band [1.732..2.002] over 5.0..5.891.
   plan_whole 87.87 -> 92+, plan_turret 88.76 -> 93.0, side_whole +2.
2. FRONT RE-METER: belly 0.26 -> 0.281 (ref front bottoms 0.283 x46
   cols); filler pots x-narrowed to the ref's ±1.033/1.073 cols; engine
   deck re-stepped 1.607/1.627/1.631 (was flat 1.632); driver hatch +
   periscopes cap-seated to the 1.534-1.544 deck line; fore-deck split
   1.534/1.549. front_hull 88.08 -> 93.5.
3. PRINT-ASYM ±1.64 KILL: the official rows read bot 0.083 right/0.501
   left from SYMMETRIC track pads at x 1.623 — pixel-grid coin-flip at
   the 1.619 window boundary. Track re-metered 0.64/1.28 -> 0.570/1.295
   (shoes 0.987..1.603) + LEFT-only skirt rubber drop strip (x -1.606..
   -1.655, hung from the sheet bottom) + RIGHT inner-lane tab at x 0.96
   (the print wants ground at +0.953 and the 0.278 belly line at -0.951).
4. WRAP FILLS (the ariete §B4 lane-local mechanism): bow two-slope
   ramp -> knee -> crest -> 3.51 front block and stern ramp -> knee ->
   tail in hullTrackTrimL/R, kit idler re-seated INSIDE (3.27/1.10/
   0.075; sprocket -2.885/1.03/0.24, far edge -3.27 EXACT). Fill E's
   3.51 face carries the plan front lane AND pads the 3.517 hullLengthM
   body column. Stern boat-tail bottom re-laid to the measured 4-knot
   rake. side_hull 86.6 -> 92.0.
5. REAR/ROOF MICRO: step filler z -3.265 (its -3.30 face + 1.01 bottom
   owned the -3.352 anchor col err 0.152); rear plate band 1.23..1.5705
   (RAZOR-ANCHOR: the filler pull left the plate band 0.300 vs the
   0.304 cut and hullLengthM silently read 6.76); rack rear cross-rail
   SEGMENTED at the ref's plan gaps; strap-end rolls + right-side-only
   pannier shelf (print asym); vents sunk to the 1.494 dip; sight block
   z -0.862..-0.982; sensor base halved + widened to the ref's -1.073
   col; loader periscope housing at the 2.351 line; mast bracket
   (0.94..1.00, top 2.50); tail-lip fender 1.695; block lower lip
   (±1.72 wants 0.779, ±1.762 wants 0.856 — per-column split); k0 block
   z 1.235..1.53; k3/k4 tops taper 1.395/1.32 with the glacis.

LAWS BANKED (this round):
1. 12% JUNCTION LAW: two fat gun pieces sharing ONE trace column merge
   their bands — sleeve[1.732..2.002] + drum[1.771..2.063] = 0.331 >
   the 12% cut, and hullLengthM swallowed the gun (9.09, dims 0,
   twice). Keep every column single-owner near the cut (sleeve rear
   5.891 | boundary 5.899 | drum front 5.907).
2. RAZOR-ANCHOR COROLLARY (§D): an anchor column's band needs >10%
   margin over the 12% cut — the -3.352 rear anchor sat at 0.300 vs
   0.304 and dropped SILENTLY (hullLengthM 6.76 while every curve row
   improved). Check dims after ANY edit near an anchor window.
3. BOX/GRID LAW (grid-coupling corollary, measured twice): ANY change
   to the shared visible box re-derives all 96-col grids — strap rolls
   at -3.587 (27 mm past the bag line) shifted side dAlong 0 -> -0.057,
   exposed a ref-only col at -3.654 and re-priced the whole roof spike
   field. Box extremes are FROZEN once tuned (z-min = bags -3.56).
4. MIN-OF-WINDOW LAW: a trace column reports the ref's MINIMUM over its
   window — a rising ref line's knots sit at window STARTS, not
   centers. Author fill polylines through the window-start points
   (2.574/2.91/3.02/3.13/3.24/3.35 here).
5. GUN-FRAME double-subtract hazard: gunExtra local = world - (gunG.z +
   turretG.z) ONCE — the first rear-sleeve seat subtracted the frame
   twice and sat 0.4 m rearward (side_whole read the bare tube).
6. PROBE PARITY: mask probes MUST render with the page's own override
   material + baseVisible parking — a raw-material probe read the
   parked hull shadow proxy and un-thresholded dark tones (two false
   attributions before the gate-identical frontcol probe).

CERTIFIED/DOCUMENTED RESIDUALS: tower lid-cap 2.52 band (heightM p95
anchor, dims-sovereign — side_whole col 0.638 err 0.075); bow idler
ramp/crest cols 3.29/3.07 (~0.10/0.04 — the circular-wrap residual
INSIDE the authored fill: shoes ride the kit arc; far-edge guard bars
a bigger idler); the -2.763-class stern ramp shoe corners; plan ±1.71
mudguard-strip front (ref asym); owner-symmetry glass-housing band
(unchanged, ratified). §B battery on final bytes: track-clip --exact
front 14/rear 0 (better than the certified 24), shoe 0/0;
turret-parent 0/0/0; standard-check clip ✓ contig 0 ✓ census mg2+0d ✓;

orientedSlab); npm test 166 + track-geometry green. Evidence:

angles each).

## FRONT MUDGUARD RESTORATION (2026-08-12)

Owner review correctly identified that the native-track conversion had fixed
the visible front-course collision by deleting the old low rubber flap, but
had also removed the recognizable Leclerc front mudguards. The old plate was
centered at z=3.28/y=0.775 and physically occupied the moving idler/shoe
envelope; it remains retired.

The replacement is an original procedural assembly on each side: a tapered
0.885 m steel cap above the idler crest, a shallow 0.64 m rubber leading lip
ahead of the forward shoe sweep, an inboard bow knee and an outboard fender
knee. The cap narrows toward the front rather than reading as a rectangular
track-cover slab. Both knees visibly intersect real hull structure, while the
rubber lip meets the cap along its upper edge. No source vertices, meshes or
opaque geometry payloads enter the playable.

Final exact `track-clip-audit --strict --exact`: band front/rear 0/0, shoes
0/0, full sweep 0/0. Freeze `5fa68984` reproduces twice (47 meshes / 85,191
vertices). The 45-frame paired/yaw packet is hash-distinct and includes the
standard elevated-left profile. Fidelity 94.0 (hull 95 / turret 91 / gun 91 /
tracks 93); parent, winding, rig, bore, provenance, family order, asset,
tests and both build lanes pass.

## §5.329 THREE-ITEM OWNER ROUND (2026-08-17, leclerc lane) — lower-glacis re-loft + enlarged/raised final drive + §B2 fills; 733d24fd -> e6523de8 x2

OWNER ORDERS (verbatim, surface-markup receipts): (1) "for the leclerc its
lower glacis is really pushed back and doesnt line up with the upper glacis.
fix" — markup hull faces 804/805, the near-vertical plate z 2.95->3.02 /
y 0.27..1.19 / x ±0.94, ~0.44-0.56 m recessed behind the beak; (2) "make its
rare wheel much larger and move it up a little without deleting any tank
parts" — markup gearEndWheelHardware, rear end wheel c (0.84, -3.00), visible
r ~0.22; (3) "the leclerc turret and hulls are also a little see throughable,
just make them filled up roperly".

ITEM 1 — LOWER GLACIS RE-LOFT. The old lower bow frustum stood a ~4-deg-
from-vertical wall at z 2.95->3.02 whose top edge sat 0.44 m BEHIND the beak
(nose plate bottom-front edge y 1.21 / z 3.46): the owner's step + an open
cavity under the beak. Replaced (same P.add slot, orientedSlab) by ONE
continuous lower-glacis plane: front face (0.27, 2.95) -> (1.21, 3.46) =
~28.5 deg from vertical, the real Leclerc nose profile; the top-front corners
SHARE the beak edge exactly (edge contact — no coplanar face, no z-fight);
top-rear corners buried in the full-width shoulder at 1.24. Bow tow shackles
re-seated from their floating z-face 3.30 (authored against the recessed
wall, ~0.28 proud of it) onto the new plane: clevis face 3.267 = 40 mm proud
of the surface at y 0.78 (centers z 3.27 -> 3.237, nubs 3.315 -> 3.282).
Front length anchors untouched: plate reach 3.46 = the existing nose tip,
front body column 3.54 (idler pads) / mudguard 3.58 / lip 3.5975 unchanged.

ITEM 2 — FINAL DRIVE (rear sprocket) ENLARGED + RAISED. cfg
sprocket { z -3.00, y 0.84, r 0.14 } -> { z -2.90, y 0.92, r 0.24 }: visible
toothed wheel r 0.22 -> 0.32 (the §B6 raised-drive class), axle +0.08 above
the old line, z pulled forward 0.10 so the wrap far edge holds the certified
rear body line EXACTLY (z - r - 0.08 band = -3.22; -3.30 with link pads —
identical to the old wheel's math; hullLengthM anchor preserved, whole-tank
AABB z-range byte-equal before/after). DELETE NOTHING honored: body,
hardware, carrier rings, wrap band and shoes all re-derive around the bigger
wheel (native loop law); wheelbase/rollers/idler untouched. XLR rider: the
XLR rear corner cell floor RAISED 1.16 -> 1.38 (same cell, same lid) clear of
the new pad crest (~1.355). §B9: the enlarged wheel reads prominently under
the cut-high skirt panel hem (0.805) from side and rear.

ITEM 3 — §B2 SWEEP + ARMOR-GRADE CLOSURES (tools/tmp-sweep-seethrough.mjs,
36-view battery incl. low/under). BEFORE worst: bow-lane holes at
[±1.3, 0.5..0.8, 2.64..2.83] (up to 255 px, fq/garage views — rays through
the open lane behind the recessed bow), stern side slivers [±0.004, 1.216,
-2.832] through the hollow band above the boat-tail wedges, brow->boot slot
[±0.01, 2.05, 2.05], beak notch [±0.003, 1.235, 3.50], chamfer front mouths
(under-fr [1.017, 2.20, 0.99]). CLOSED with real geometry (§5.303/§5.326
class): the item-1 plane itself (bow lane: fqr 288 -> 22 px, garage 263 -> 8),
ENGINE-BAY REAR FILL box(1.88, 0.50, 0.60) @ (0, 1.30, -2.95) — the y
1.05..1.55 / z -2.65..-3.25 band above the wedges was hollow; rear face
-3.25 clear of the -3.352 anchor column window (stern slivers now 0),
CANVAS BASE FOLD box(0.52, 0.194, 0.10) @ turret (0, 0.433, 2.155) bridging
brow -> boot at the 2.13w line inside the clamp-frame plan footprint,
BEAK CENTER CAP box(1.96, 0.06, 0.12) @ (0, 1.22, 3.46) — the bow cross-lip
bridging nose tip -> mudguard tips (notch 32 px -> 12 px kit-sliver), and
CHAMFER FRONT BULKHEADS (slab pair 5 mm under the sheet line) plugging the
hollow chamfer wedges. AFTER: every remaining enclosed read classified in
pixels as HONEST OPEN FURNITURE AIR (under pintle-MG receivers/barrels
~2.35w, under the stowed bustle whips, basket-frame slots, turret-overhang
keyholes, XLR standoff-ERA channels, amx56 RWS underspace) or certified
cm-class slivers (skirt-sheet hairlines 0.005 m, beak fringe 0.037 x 0.049) —
filling gun/basket airspace would be fake armor on priced roof windows.
Variants sweep-verified (leclerc_xlr, amx56): closures inherited, no new
structural voids.
