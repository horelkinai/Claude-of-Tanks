# Type 10B — packet

First-party JGSDF Type 10 up-armored variant (`type10b`, profiles/japan.ts).
History through §5.308 lives in docs/references/tanks/type10.md (the
japan-wave base was pinned verbatim for this mark as buildType10BBase,
hashgeo 77870ef0).

## §5.336 OWNER ORDER — enlargement + fleet gear + quality (2026-08-17)
Order verbatim: "make the type 10s larger make their tracks much better
using our better track system and make their hulls and turrets much mcuh
beter" — "the type 10s" = BOTH marks.

- **The §5.299/§5.308 byte-pin (77870ef0) is RETIRED BY OWNER AUTHORITY.**
  The §5.299 "keep the type 10b" bound to its LOOK; this order supersedes
  the byte-freeze: buildType10BBase now delegates to the rebuilt ×1.10
  shared base (modern3.ts buildType10Native2026 — full receipts in
  type10.md §5.336). The pinned copy's two §B4 deltas (sprocket-bay roof
  split, trimmed fender/relief ends) were absorbed into the shared base at
  the new stations, so nothing of the pin's content is lost — it is
  superseded, at scale, for both marks.
- **B-variant identity delta PRESERVED, re-seated at ×1.10** (profiles/
  japan.ts addType10BPackage): swept modular cheek shell, 2×5 cassette rows
  per cheek, six high hull cassettes per flank (inner faces re-seated on
  the new 1.6606 skirt outer plane — §B2 no-air; outer 1.7102 inside the
  ±1.782 width anchor), paired EO stations (JGSDF asymmetry), shielded
  commander RWS (roofWeapon, MG scale 0.858), 6-tube smoke banks, joined
  bustle basket + rails, twin whips, Type 10 Kai closed mask + strengthened
  sleeve, '10-B' decal. Shared japan.ts helpers took an opt-in `s` scale
  param with byte-identical defaults (§F.2): A/B receipt — type90a
  71208238 + stb1 f3ee84d8 hash EXACTLY the same with HEAD's japan.ts vs
  this lane's.
- Spec dims ×1.10 exact: **7.513 / 10.439 / 3.564 / 2.838** (variant()
  copies the scaled type10 armor frame verbatim; armorFactor 1.16 thickness
  multipliers unchanged).

## Registration status — FALSE-0 class (documented)
type10b has NO registered oracle and NO geometry-gate row ("no gate json" in
tank-standard-check; docs/geometry-gate/ has no type10b.json; the ledger has
no type10b row). Per §E law a row cannot be written without a registered
reference — the absence is the correct state, not a defect. Evidence class
is therefore procedural-only frames + the shared-base gate row (type10
67.2 ×2, dims 100) + the full audit battery below.

## §5.336 battery (final bytes, hashgeo ca20604 — 79 meshes / 98,612 verts)
- track-clip --exact --strict: **0 front / 0 rear / 0 shoe / 0 sweep**.
- duplicate-course: PASS (one suspension-driven integrated layer).
- standard-check: holes **0**, decor census **mg2+14d**, clip 0/0+0/0.
- turret-parent: 0 dangling / 0 abutting / 5 stranded = the certified
  false-flag deck-gear class inherited from the shared base (adjudicated
  LEAVE; yaw90 receipts shots/type10-enlarge/after/type10b/yaw90/ show the
  whole B kit — shell, cassettes, RWS, basket, whips — rotating as one).
- winding audit: m1 0 reversed / 0 mixed; m2 clean.
- muzzle-bore probe: PASS (bore + collar through the Kai mask).
- assets: 9 files regenerated (tank:assets), tank-assets-check PASS.
- npm test && production build exit 0.
- Evidence: shots/type10-enlarge/before/critic-type10b/ (14 procedural-only
  frames at the pre-edit tree) + shots/type10-enlarge/after/type10b/
  (14 paired + 14 yaw0 + 14 yaw90 at final bytes); garage family read in
  shots/type10-enlarge/after-garage/pair-s1.png (X Type 10B beside IX
  Type 10 / Type 90 in the JP tab).

## §5.364 packet — pivot re-auth + owner orders (rides the shared base) (2026-08-17)
- Item 1 (§5.362 finding): rig/sim pivots re-authored to the exact
  retired-remap outputs in japan.ts (post-clone block; see the type10.md
  §5.364 packet for the law and derivation): turretPivot
  `[0, 1.8027777777777776, 0.2713333333333332]`, gunPivot
  `[0, 0.4511015831134565, 1.1771211453744495]` (the B's measured turret
  envelope is symmetric — no x offset, unlike the base mark). Item-1-alone
  proof: hashgeo returned to the certified **ca20604** exact.
- Items 2-5 ride the rebuilt shared base (buildType10Native2026): black
  line retired, bay walls/struts, bow closures, skirt/panel raises,
  beefier §B6 course — receipts in shots/type10-fix/ (before-/after1z-/
  final-/cert-/pairfinal-type10b sets). The B identity delta (cheek shell,
  cassette rows, high side cassettes on the 1.6606 skirt outer plane, EO
  pair, RWS, Kai mask, basket, whips) is UNTOUCHED and stays flush over
  the raised skirts (§B2 no-air held).
- See-through after: zero interior rows (worst remaining open cell class =
  stern-overhang/beak-taper air, designed openness). track-clip strict
  0/0/0/0. FALSE-0 gate class unchanged (no reference row).
- Final hash **5e6f7700** (81/104,096), live == pinned-worktree
  clean-room. Guards type90 **518e88f0** / type90a **71208238**
  byte-held under this lane's files (clean-room A/B at 7b85fe43).
- npm test EXIT 0 + production build EXIT 0. Delivered UNCOMMITTED.
