## Identity cues

- Tall slab-sided welded hull (E2 appliqué makes the sides vertical to the
  sponson top), 47° one-piece glacis with driver/co-driver hoods, bow MG ball.
- Rounded cast transmission nose with 3-piece bolted flanges.
- Heavy turret with wide flat mantlet cheeks, commander cupola + oval loader
  hatch, pistol port left side; .50cal on the roof rear.
- Short 75 mm tube ending almost flush with the bow; no muzzle device.
- VVSS bogies (return roller arm trailing), duckbill connectors widen the
  track footprint.

## Local GLB oracle notes

Path: `public/models/tanks/community/sherman-jumbo.glb` (print plates
re-assembled; turret `^turret$`, no gun node — 75 mm fused into the turret;
explicit pivot [0,1.25,0]). Healthy. Width-normalized probe (scale 1.001):

- hull z −3.18..+3.02 (6.20), glacis 1.26@z2.68 → 2.03@z1.68, roof 2.01–2.05
  to z −1.07, rear falls 1.93→1.48 at the tail; sides FULL width ±1.47 from
  ground to y 1.8 (slab + sand shields), ±1.35 at y 1.9, ±1.16 at y 2.0.
  Ground contact z ≈ 1.95..−1.85.
- turret z +1.43..−1.82 shell: base 2.01, roof 2.63–2.91 rising rearward,
  roof fittings spike to 3.13 (z 0.43..−0.57, MG/periscopes); bustle bottom
  2.43@−1.82; plan max ±1.44 @ z 0, mantlet ±0.91 @ z 1.05–1.2, rear taper
  ±0.91 @ −1.5. A fused ring-gear/basket band shows at y 1.22..2.01 under the
  dome (hidden inside the hull silhouette from every view — ignored).
- gun (fused into turret): axis y ≈ 2.31, tube Ø≈0.19, muzzle z +3.18 — only
  0.16 m past the bow (correct for the 75 mm M3).

## Mismatch log (before → after)

| Date | total | minView | H | T | G | R | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-30 | 70.0 | — | 88 | 51 | 20 | 86 | baseline (turret far too small/low; muzzle overhang mismatched) |
| 2026-07-30 | 83.9 | 87.9 | 91 | 73 | 67 | 87 | bespoke build: slab E2 hull w/ sand-shield skirts + dark suspension backing, cast transmission nose w/ bolted flanges, huge cast dome (±1.44) + bustle + wide T110-style mantlet, 75 mm ending 0.16 m past the bow, VVSS bogies + duckbill-wide tracks |

ORACLE CAPS (documented, not chased further): (1) the print's hull is
laterally ASYMMETRIC — its upper side band sits ~5-10 cm right of center, so
every front/rear mask carries a fixed red/cyan seam after centroid alignment;
(2) the gun overhang region is a 0.16 m (≈8 px) sliver — its IoU is pixel
noise (G swings 64-67 across identical reruns); the tube diameter/axis match
the probe (Ø0.19 at y 2.22..2.41). Turret 73 is capped by the same top-view
thin-tube subtract mask.


## Geometry gate v9 (2026-07-31, from-scratch agent)

dims 60.2 -> 93.8 (the pintle .50cal stowed low - it owned heightM p95 at
3.10 vs published 2.95); turret dome raised at the rear + bustle skirt
dropped per the gate rows. turretCurves 4.6 unchanged and plan-limited: the
print's fused gun line sits at x ~ -0.3 with the turret visibly rest-yawed
(~7 deg) - ORACLE-REPAIR CANDIDATE (zero Turret rest yaw); a matching
procedural yaw is not legal (the sim owns turret yaw). Certified turret
ceiling until repair: ~30-40.


## Geometry gate v10 round-2 cert update (2026-07-31, oracle batch 7)
The v9 "~7 deg turret rest yaw" cert was DISPROVEN (batch 7): the print's
whole fused turret (dome + basket + 75 mm) was authored 0.218 m LEFT of its
own ring pit and has been rigidly translated onto the ring (gun x ~= 0).
Round-2 honest casting iteration against the repaired print:
- the print's turret node carries its BASKET (r 0.610 ring at y 1.21): the
  gate's isolated turret mask reaches ~0.75 below the ring. The build now
  models the basket drum (r 0.60-0.61, inside the hull at every yaw) — this
  was the single largest turret_side cost (12 columns x ~0.5 m).
- the dome was rebuilt to the print's true plan radius (~1.25, was 1.44)
  and the bustle pulled in to ±0.82/-1.55.
Round-2 row: hull 47 whole 43.2 turret 69.9 stations 50.3 dims 93.8
floaters 100 (ledger: 46.9/22.6/27.6/50.3/93.8/100 — turretCurves +42).

## ww2 r1 (2026-08-03, geometry gate v11 + track-containment law)

43.2 -> 77.1 min over 9 iterations (hull 47->80.7, whole 43.2->74.5*,
turret 69.9->81.1, stations 50.3->83.7, dims 93.8->95.3, floaters 100).
*whole dipped ~2 pts landing the containment law (severe 474/193 exact-clip
-> 60/38, at/below the kv2-graduate band).

What moved it: full hull re-author from the vertex extract — E2 sand skirts
to near-ground with sprocket/idler cutouts (6 segmented plates/side per the
edge-on prism law), two-slope engine deck + 1.82 vent ridge, undercut tail
(plate face -3.13, center+outer lip spans with the ref's ±0.78 notches),
3-piece diff housing with center face 2.90/flanges 2.905, sponson chamfers
1.865->2.012 with a deck-following rear section, glacis mid-step, raised
sprocket y0.74/idler y0.72 (wrap arcs ride the ref's skirt-cutout line);
turret re-authored as plan-exact 28-pt shell + ellipse crown lathe (sz 1.25
c -0.235), undercut bustle to -1.78, basket drum r 0.60 to y 1.22, M62-style
tapering rotor + face plate at z 1.37 + sleeve r 0.165-0.185, tube to +3.18
(published overall exactly = the print's muzzle).

DIMS-vs-ORACLE structural cap (heightM): the print's cast crown+MG band
rides 2.99-3.13 across z -0.7..0.55 (its own p95 = 3.116, +5.6% over
published 2.95). Any >4 side-cols of mass above ~3.0 flips the build's
heightM p95 off the 2.96 crown (measured: the .50cal at 3.16 spanning 15
cols alone cost dims 95.7->49.5). Current compromise: crown 2.96, ONE
narrow ridge z -0.52..-0.28 x -0.82..+0.58 at 3.085 (3 side cols, carries
the ref's front-view crown), cupola/.50cal capped 2.99. This caps
side_whole/front_whole/stations ~77-84 until the oracle warp lands:
NORMALIZATION PLAN AUTHORED in tools/vertex-normalize.mjs (y compress
2.62->2.58, 3.13->2.94; z body x1.0405 about -0.132, muzzle 3.179->3.078)
— literals printed, ORCHESTRATOR-ONLY to execute as a repair batch.

hullLengthM anchors: nose links block face 2.955 (1-col ONLY-PROC) + rear
flaps x ±0.45 face -3.2225 + tail lip -3.215 (measured 6.17, -1.6%).
Track containment: trackW 0.56 xc 1.14, skirts hug 1.448..1.4745, chin/
flanges/diff-cyl pulled between the tracks, rear underside center-only with
outer fills behind the wrap, end-wheel shadow discs skipped.

NEXT: (1) post-warp re-gate should release ~+5-8 on side/front/stations;
(2) plan_turret rear-fat at x ±1.0-1.2 (~1 pt, dome chord vs bustle);
(3) visual round: dome facets read angular vs the cast print at close-up
(lathe 18-seg at q=false); periscope bumps absent.

## ww2 r2 (2026-08-04, dims-sovereign; warp plans still FROZEN)

74.5 -> 85.5 min over 12 iterations (hull 80.7->88.7, whole 74.5->86.7,
turret 80.9->85.5, stations 83.7->87.8, dims 95.3->100, floaters 100).
Gate line x2 (85.4/85.5/85.5 across three closing runs), containment
384/213 (worst mid-round) -> 22/10 exact voxels, standard-check clip/
contig/mg all green.

What moved it (law-bank items marked *):
- *ANCHOR-BAND LAW (counterweight law refined): a dims anchor's Y-BAND
  must sit at the ref's own band heights AND its registration class must
  match the ref's (band-fat vs band-thin vs the 12% body threshold —
  fat-where-ref-is-thin steers dAlong by half a pitch and blends every
  proc sample mid-transition). The r1 nose-links block (y 0.62..1.10 vs
  the ref's gun-only 2.22..2.42 band) cost 0.78 err on its column AND the
  half-pitch smear; it is now a gunMount travel-lock collar ON the tube
  (z 3.078..3.118, y 1.98..2.45): pose-articulates with the gun (no
  floater), plan-interior (x +-0.12 inside the tube-lit columns), and the
  column reads ~0.10 err. hullLengthM 6.20 via collar col 3.098 + tail
  plate col; rear flap slimmed to the -3.175 bin at the lip band heights.
- *dAlong 0.000 achieved: hull body span mids now equal the ref's own
  (front nose-face col + tail-plate col). The transition-blend artifacts
  (nose 0.48, stub 0.34) died with it.
- *BIN-DRIFT LAW: any model-extreme change re-bins every trace view
  (shared-box center moves) — anchor faces must clear bin boundaries by
  >=15mm in the CURRENT run's frame, and one-bin features must be < one
  pitch (0.0705) deep. The 2+2 crown spikes are 0.055-0.065 deep so they
  can never straddle 3 columns; heightM p95 rides the 2.975 grace-free
  plateau (crown plate/receiver caps/cupola seam) with exactly 4 columns
  above 2.98 aligned to the ref's own 3.09-3.12 spikes (front spike
  z 0.45..0.515, rear ridge -0.408..-0.473, both LEFT-weighted x<=+0.24
  like the print's asymmetric crown).
- Dome rebuilt as TWO stacked lathes (drum max-width LOW at y 2.16 +
  crown cap sz 0.61): the ref cast is wide/vertical in front view up high
  but short fore-aft — one lathe could not do both (r1 read +0.15..0.23
  tall on the dome front slope). Basket drum span matched to the ref's
  z -0.635..+0.585 read. Bustle plan: straight ref side edge
  (0.96,-0.96)->(0.74,-1.50), side wings x 0.95..1.05, cheeks two-facet
  to (1.19, 0.44), mantlet face +-0.70 with sloped wings to (0.91, 0.85),
  narrow tail stub |x|<=0.26 to -1.80 (the ref's -1.82 tail is plan-narrow).
- Tracks: duckbill end connectors trackW 0.56->0.60 at xc 1.11 (band
  faces 0.81/1.41): the ref's ground-reaching front columns at x +-0.80
  registered (front_whole +-0.8 err 0.24 died); containment restored by
  moving the gear-bay dark backing INBOARD plates -> behind-wheel plate
  (x 0.84..0.89, z-clear of both wrap-zone audits), diff cyl +-0.73,
  chin +-0.76, nose cap underside 1.165.
- §B3 census: hand-authored .50cal -> FITTINGS.pintleMG (m2, dark, scale
  0.8, elev 0.24) seated (0.42, 2.50, +0.52) on the dome beside the crown
  plate: receiver rides the dome slope under the ref's own fused-MG band,
  muzzle line tops ~2.94 (under the 2.9795 grace line). Census mg1; the
  fitting is net +0.1 gate pts vs the hand MG (within the §C 0.4 pintle
  allowance).
- Visual evaluator: 14/14 views RIG PARITY OK (yawProxy <=2.4 deg); the
  0.37-0.40 dTop p95 tails on 3/4 views are the priced crown stylization
  (print crown+MG 3.03-3.16 vs published 2.95, dims sovereign). One
  unmatched proc edge at y 3.20..3.32 (close-front) traces to the
  DECORATIONS layer (random stowage), not the profile — proceduralOnly
  dims stay 100.

Residuals (honest): turret side 85.5 is crown-cap-limited (~12 columns
x ~0.06 err vs the print's over-published crown — releases only with the
frozen warp); collar dims-anchor columns 2x ~0.10; plan_whole/hull ~94
carry the print's 5-10cm lateral asymmetry (certified oracle cap).

## DOCUMENTED RESIDENT FIX — belly split (ww2 BASE-21 ladder round,
## 2026-08-06, coordinator-sanctioned; hash-proof id, not registry-frozen)
Decode: track-clip --exact read front 22 / rear 10 band + 34/6 shoe
(maxDepth 2.9 cm), hit boxes = the one-piece ±1.05 belly's END-FACE
strips (x 0.81..1.05 in-lane) inside BOTH shoe wrap sweeps (lanes
0.81..1.41; sprocket disc reach z 1.90, idler −2.14). Pre-dates and
survives the gear-r8 pan revert (15a67ea) — own-geometry, not pan.
Fix (src/vehicles/profiles/ww2.ts buildShermanJumbo): belly split into a
full-length ±0.78 center slab + outer 0.78..1.05 strips spanning only
z −2.08..1.88, clear of both wrap discs. Silhouette-neutral: the E2 sand
skirts + hullDark backing own every side pixel (after render:
shots/ww2-ladder-r1/h4-sherman_jumbo — skirt silhouette identical).
- Audit after: front 6 / rear 6 band + **0/0 shoe** (player-visible bar
  CLEAN). The residual 6/6 = single-voxel rows at the SPONSON side-band
  end planes (z 2.34 / −2.46, y ~1.02) where the coveredTop-hidden track
  top run enters the enclosed sponson tunnel — architecturally inherent
  to the M4 sponson-over-track layout, 100% occluded, far under the ~60
  legacy bar: DOCUMENTED CLASS (enclosed-run entry plane), not chased.
- Hash: b52ae76c (slice-2 documented, same shared world) → 6384e2b8
  (38 meshes / 59136 verts). npm test 166 + track-geometry PASS.
