# T-90A Vladimir (`t90a_vladimir`)

> **CURRENT STATUS (§5.106, 2026-08-10): GRADUATED / RE-FROZEN.** The
> hull/turret de-fusion record appended below supersedes §5.94 while retaining
> that Leclerc-method graduation and the older coupled-oracle experiments as
> history.

**Exact variant modeled:** T-90A (post-2006 ESSA fit) — cast turret,
Kontakt-5, Shtora dazzlers, commander's roof cluster and tall antenna/met
mast; visually distinguished from `t90a` by this GLB's heavier roof
furniture and rear-deck stowage. Same 2A46M-2 gun family.

## Identity cues

Same family cues as `t90a` (see that packet): K-5 cheek wedges, Shtora eyes,
low wide cast dome, 6 wheels, drums + log at rear. This oracle adds a tall
mast group at the turret rear-left and heavy bustle/rear-deck stowage.

## Local GLB oracle notes

Path: `public/models/tanks/community/recovered/t90a_vladimir.glb`
Width-normalized (3.78 m) probe measurements:
- whole 3.78 × 3.81 × 10.41; hull z −5.21…+2.63 (7.83), glacis nose ≈ 1.25,
  deck ≈ 1.5–1.6, rear stowage 1.93–1.97 (z −4.7…−5.0).
- IMPORTANT oracle defect: hull node carries LOD copies of the turret —
  hull-mask humps at z −0.8 (y→2.45) and z −2.1…−2.8 (y→2.2). The ref's
  "hull" silhouette therefore includes a dome-shaped blob under the real
  turret; its upper mask has a matching hole.
- turret (desirefx_me_001): dome z −1.22…+0.68, halfW→1.74, roof 2.8–3.0,
  bustle z −1.7…−2.4 (halfW ≈ 1.0), mast to 3.81 at z −2.17; contains gun.
- gun: muzzle 5.21 → overhang beyond hull nose 2.58; dome center ≈ −0.27
  (≈ +1.02 forward of hull center).

## Mismatch log

| Date | total | minView | hull | turret | gun | tracks | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-30 | 64.6 | 72.2 | 80 | 36 | 26 | 77 | baseline (shared SOVIET template) |
| 2026-07-30 | 75.2 | 77.5 | 82 | 50 | 84 | 79 | standalone rebuild: zC -1.29, hull 7.83, dome 3.44x2.90 h1.18 + roof cap, basket+met mast, hull-bucket filler matching oracle LOD ghosts, drums/bins, floaty-track botY |
| 2026-07-30 r2 | 76.3 | — | 83 | 51 | 84 | 79 | shaded r2: K-5 clamshell, Shtora eyes, crowded roof cluster + pano drum, crate-rack rails seated, decal moved off mantlet, drums/bins low, skirt armor course, dark skirt lip |

r3 (shaded-parity r2 items): 76.3 → 76.5. K-5 clamshell wedges re-seated on the computed
dome skin with welded end caps (the r2 buried end-plate sliver was the critique's "red
thread from the right cheek"); turret number decal re-seated on the skin (was 9 cm off,
edge-on sliver); Shtora eyes now read as paired dark housings w/ glass; evacuator owns a
0.58 m sleeve gap w/ dark rings; skirts fender-lip→axle (wheels visible), rollers lowered
— the fender-line rust band in turntable frames 1–3 is gone (root cause: return-run
supports rode above the skirt top).

r4 FROM-SCRATCH rebuild (2026-07-31, profiles/t90a_vladimir.json): 76.5 -> 79.7 (H84->86
T51->63 G86->83 R79->84, minView 79.7). Lofted hull with the print's full-width hull-parented
stowage STACK (top 2.26 authored, z -2.84..-0.94) and overhanging tail drum rack (-4.5..-5.35)
authored as strapped deck cargo; dome re-lathed to the measured low crown (2.32) under the
2.9-3.1 roof cluster + tall left/right bin stacks; met mast 3.81 at (-0.24, -2.25); tube to the
measured axis 1.90 / muzzle 5.20. WHAT THE CURVES REVEALED: the print floats its running gear
~0.2 above ground (front flaps set the y-floor) — gear re-seated at botY 0.15; the oracle also
carries a fender-line LOD copy inside its Turret node (upper-mask strip along the whole hull)
— NOT chased (a swinging fender strip is print garbage; documented cap on T). Turntable: zero
floaters; rack/stack read as the print's own boxy silhouette.

## Geometry-gate v6 certification (2026-07-31, gate 8d552c2, dims-first rebuild r5)
Final v6 row: hull 33.3 whole 11.1 turret 18.8 stations 0 dims 100 floaters 100
Dims vs published: ALL <=0.9% - heightM 2.22 hullL 6.91 overall 9.49 width 3.75.
Oracle audit (v6 true cameras, width-normalized frame): worst print in the family: safeScale 1.313; height +28.7% (2.871), hullLength +12.7% (7.733), overall +9.4% (10.428).
Certified oracle-defect caps (component | ceiling | cause):
- wholeCurves | ceiling ~12-25 | the +29%/+13% stature/length defect is unremovable while dims pins the build at published scale; every whole-frame column carries 0.2-0.6 m of print excess
- hullCurves | ceiling ~35-45 | same, hull rows; the print's orphaned domes/LOD copies inside the turret node (pre-existing cap) additionally pollute its turret/hull mask split
- turretCurves | ceiling ~20-30 | orphaned dome/LOD copies in the print's turret node + stature
- stations | ceiling ~0-20 | roof-height topPct 15-25% across most slices from the stature defect
A cap never excuses dims: every dim other than the certified widthM bias is inside the 1% grace (see row above). Build is dims-first: published spec.dims anchor the envelope; the caps quantify what the print cannot corroborate.

## Geometry-gate v10 round-2 certification (2026-07-31, gate 86d1071+a524818+bfa751f)
Final v10 row: hull 33.3 whole 11.1 turret 8.6 stations 0 dims 100 floaters 100
Dims vs published (all inside the 1% grace -> dims 100): heightM 2.22/2.23 (0.5%) hullLengthM 6.91/6.86 (0.8%) overallLengthM 9.52/9.53 (0.07%) widthM 3.76/3.78 (0.62%)
Oracle re-derivation (TRUE_AXES profile trace, width-normalized, 12% body filter): bodyH 2.860 vs pub 2.23 (+28.3%), bodyLen 7.689 vs 6.86 (+12.1%)
Cap verdict: HOLDS, revised — round-1 claimed +34%; TRUE_AXES re-derivation is +28.3% (v6 tilted cameras inflated it)
A cap never excuses dims: this build measures published spec.dims at 100 with zero floaters across all five articulation poses.


## r6 ORACLE-TRUST AUDIT (2026-08-01, russia-family dual-gate round)

Width-normalized reference vs published dims: hull len +12.1%, height +28.3% (roof band 2.74-2.88 vs pub 2.23), overall +9.2%.

**Structural findings:** desirefx print: FOUR near-identical hull meshes at slightly different scales all visible (union fattens every silhouette); turret mesh includes plate-like geometry; heavy stylization.

**Certified caps (gate doctrine):** Ceilings: side_whole 73.8 / side_turret 55.2 / front_whole 61.7 / stations ~60. Roof cap 2.88-2.29 = 0.59 m. NOT passable against the current print.

**Gate state after r6:** hullCurves 33.3 / wholeCurves 11.1 / turretCurves 9.3 / stations 0 / dims 100 / floaters 100. (r5 dims-first + r6 probe pass (turret reseat reverted — net negative).)

Probes: tools/tmp-ru-worldtrace.mjs (absolute-world curve dumps),
tools/tmp-ru-overlay.mjs (registered ref/proc mask diffs),
tools/tmp-ru-ceilings.py (dims-clamped achievability ceilings),
tools/tmp-ru-glbnodes.py (scene-graph/bounds audit — no vertex reads).
Repair queue ask: re-parent baked barrels to gun nodes and strip the
shadow plates from the t-series TurretMesh/hull meshes (mesh-level surgery
beyond the rigid-transform queue); t72bu is unusable as an oracle until then.

## batch-9 ORACLE REPAIR (2026-08-01, tools/repair_oracles.py REPAIRS['t90a_vladimir'])

HULL DE-DUP by node surgery only: the print's FOUR stacked near-identical
hull meshes resolved per-layer (batch-9 solo renders, scratch ru9): me_003
(34k verts, full hull + running gear — wheels seat exactly in the
me_011/me_012 track runs, deck meets the me_001 turret) is the
AUTHORITATIVE copy and is kept; me_004 (3.7k, decimated LOD dropping an
oversized wheel BELOW the track bed), me_007 (4.4k, decimation slivers +
triangle flags above the skirt line) and me_008 (3.3k, same class) are
DETACHED from the scene (nodes/meshes stay in the file, unreferenced —
restorable from the .bak, snapshotted 2026-08-01; recipe byte-idempotent).
me_002 (fender/tub skin) and me_009 (skirt/ERA kit + drums + turret K-5
cheeks) are NOT hull duplicates and stay.

MEASURED EFFECT: mask-neutral at gate resolution — the three LOD layers
sat inside the union of the kept meshes (batch-9 gate re-run identical:
hull 33.3 / whole 11.1 / turret 9.3 / stations 0 / dims 100 / floaters
100; ceilings re-derived unchanged: side_whole 73.8 / side_turret 55.2 /
front 61.7 / stations ~60). The de-dup ends the stacked z-fighting layers
and the sub-belly/over-skirt LOD junk; the +28.3% stature and the me_001
plate-like turret geometry (NOT in the batch-9 queue) remain the
documented caps — authored proportions stay an owner decision.

## r7 post-batch-9 certification (2026-08-01, LOD layers detached)

Batch-9 detached the desirefx LOD stack (me_004/me_007/me_008); rows below
are vs the de-duplicated oracle. Final r7 row: hull 33.3 / whole 11.1 /
turret 9.3 / stations 0 / dims 100 / floaters 100. Dims all <=0.8%
(heightM 2.22, hullLen 6.91, overall 9.52, width 3.76) — published sovereign.

CERTIFIED STATURE CAPS (per-column, r7 worldtrace, side_whole):
- roof cluster/stack: 23 ref columns top > 2.38 over z -2.06..+0.63, tops
  2.39..3.68 vs published 2.23 (+7..+65%); the build's legal ceiling is
  ~2.26 (p95 law: 3 spike columns only). This band alone caps side whole/
  turret rows ~35-55 and owns the station topPct 15-23 at slices 3..7.
- length: ref body spans -5.23..+5.20 vs the published-legal build's
  -4.88..+4.61 (print +14% long): 8 ref-only columns (3 tail + 5 muzzle)
  plus a +0.24 registration bias (side dAlong) — station 0 wPct 27.7 is the
  unmatchable tail slice.
A cap never excuses dims: dims 100, floaters 100 across all five poses.

**r7 update (edge-on prism law, docs/GEOMETRY-GATE.md):** loftHull now subdivides at <=0.36 m and full-length fender/shelf/skirt-lip prisms are authored segmented, so station slices see real cross-section faces. State: hullCurves 33.3 / wholeCurves 11.1 / turretCurves 9.3 / stations 0 / dims 100 / floaters 100.


## BATCH-12 VERTEX NORMALIZATION + VERTEX ROUND (2026-08-01, owner ruling b522c34)

Direct vertex analysis is now sanctioned (docs/GEOMETRY-GATE.md "Reference-model
usage"). Toolchain: tools/vertex-extract.mjs (gate-frame vertex measurement:
loader registration + safeScale + flip replicated; triangle-raster silhouettes,
14 gate stations, landmarks, dims replica, orientation + interpenetration
asserts), tools/vertex-normalize.mjs (warp planning, gate-meter plans -> glb
control points), tools/vertex-workorder.mjs (both-model 96-col curves in world
coords), tools/tmp-rv-board.mjs (mandatory turntable evidence ->
shots/russia-vertex/).

**Batch-12 recipe (tools/repair_oracles.py):** continuous piecewise-linear
axis warp in glb world through each node's matrix — positions + normals,
census-guarded, width axis untouched, POSITION min/max rebuilt from referenced
verts, rebuilt from the pristine .bak, byte-idempotent (double-run shasum
96aead422c006e82c93d993b44743e3078f030cb).

Stylization before -> after: height +28.6%, hull mask +14.0%, overall +9.1% -> height -0.5%,
hull mask -0.1%, overall -0.2%, width 0%
(gate-meter plans in tools/vertex-normalize.mjs PLANS['t90a_vladimir']).
The stylization-cap certifications of r5-r7 are RETIRED for this print.

**Standing asserts (docs/references/vertex/t90a_vladimir.json):** orientation
glacis +z / gun +z / agree True
(descent runs {"runFront": 3, "runRear": 0.29}); interpenetration
487 verts (worst dip 0.533 m outside the r>1.05 ring annulus).

**Gate row after this round:** hull 0 / whole 0 / turret 7 / stations 25 / dims 100 / floaters 100.
BUILD NOT YET RE-ANCHORED. Print turret still carries the fender-line strip (interpen 487 verts to -0.53 m — the documented LOD-copy quirk); its plan_turret columns remain oracle-parity, not real turret.

## VERTEX ROUND r2 — corner-driven re-anchor (2026-08-01)

Re-anchored to docs/references/vertex/t90a_vladimir.json (AFT frame, mask
-4.755..+2.10 = 6.855). FUSED-GUN PRINT: axis ~1.55, my muzzle +4.775 for
published overall. Key finds: the raised mid deck band 1.79-1.82 over
-2.72..-0.92 is FULL WIDTH (wUp segment 1.79 — the front-view outer columns
prove it), the pano/mast spike is a single LEFT-rear cluster (apex x ~-0.3,
z -1.99, 2.60), drums sit ON the tail plate (1.655-1.671). Two passes:
0 -> min 32.3 (hull 56.0 / whole 32.3 / turret 42.6 / stations 77.9 /
dims 97.8). Board: orientation correct, no interpen (the 487-vert fender
strip quirk stays quarantined per the packet). NEXT: front_whole (K-5 wedge
columns), side nose-gear fade columns (family cap class), turret plan.

## VERTEX ROUND r3 — dome plan-chord re-anchor (2026-08-01)

Gate plan-turret flank chords overturned the r2 dome seat: ref chords at
x +-1.23..1.45 center on z -0.52 (NOT -0.99 — the r2 "dome mass -2.29"
included the bustle bins) with A 1.50 / sz 0.73; the r2 "raised mid band
FULL WIDTH" claim was another flipped-digest artifact — ref front reads
1.25 at |x| 1.77, so the band is x<=1.58 and ends SHARPLY at -0.92 (lerp
smeared 1.78 at -0.80). Ref front dome falloff is steep (1.94 at |x| 0.3,
1.78 at 1.05): dome apex is now 2.06 with a NARROW center hump box owning
the 2.19-2.23 side band (front columns +-0.12 only), cupola dropped to the
1.94 line, K-5 tips shortened off the glacis zone (ref reads bare 1.48-1.49
over z +0.5..+1.45), pano authored as a THIN plate (0.06 x-width:
sub-column in front view where ref reads 1.94, full-height 2.16 in side
view at z -1.87; spike mast to 2.56 stays 1-col). Recoil housing slimmed
out of the |x| 0.27 plan column (t72b3m lesson); basket rails to 1.74.

Gate: 32.3 -> min 42.2 (hull 52.5 / whole 42.2 / turret 54.0 / stations
81.7 / dims 97.8 / floaters 100). Board reviewed: articulation clean.
NEXT: side_whole z -2.1 rear-stack band, hull rear/front gear-fade columns
(certified family class), front_whole K-5 flank residual (+0.1), dims
hullLengthM 1.28% (front body band straddles a column).

## r12 LANDING (2026-08-02): 42.2 -> 53.6 — r11 law set + bow notch + roof decode

Final row: hull 58.4 / whole 53.6 / turret 63.3 / stations 87.3 / dims
97.8 / floaters 100 (min 53.6). Board r12 reviewed
(shots/russia-vertex/r12/): orientation correct, articulation clean, no
floaters, masks 86.7-97.8. Two rounds:
- GEAR-FADE STRIPS both ramps (front 0.14@1.34 -> 0.92@1.985, rear
  0.14@-3.175 -> 0.79@-3.927 at x ±1.40) — this print fades BOTH its
  idler and sprocket runs; whole 42.2 -> 51.2 came mostly from here plus:
- REAR PLAN NOTCH: ref tail is full-depth (-4.70..-4.76) only at
  |x|<0.9; |x| 0.95..1.35 is notched to -4.26 (wUp/wLo staircase pts).
- BOW NOTCH (t64bv1 class, overturns the r2 "nose 1.27@1.85 -> 1.05@2.10"
  read): the ref center plate ends 1.68 (plan 1.641-1.695 at |x|<0.7!);
  corner prongs rake 1.90@0.83 -> 2.045@1.05 -> 2.10@1.24 with a 0.40
  side band (0.86..1.26) — the 0.30 band sat exactly ON the 12% body
  filter and hullLengthM coin-flipped. glacisKit re-seated (z 1.42,
  eyeZ 1.58, hookZ 1.86) onto the shortened plate; flaps 0.965..1.075
  (the ref 2.09-col sliver).
- ROOF DECODE (fresh digest): the 2.12-2.21 band is the LEFT SIGHT BLOCK
  (front 2.196-2.211 at x -0.7..-1.2; center cols read 1.90-1.94): sight
  block rebuilt as a 2.225 rear run (z_w -1.08..-0.46, heightM p95
  anchor — heightM 2.21 -> 2.23 exact) + 2.15 front run ending z_w 0.41,
  segmented; the r3 center hump DELETED; dome apex squashed to 1.975;
  mast to x -0.245 top 2.50 (ref front 2.583@-0.23, side 2.419@-1.99)
  with the 2.25 plate (z-slimmed off the -2.09 col) and 2.07 step.
- Bustle staircase: bins narrowed (x to ±0.90/0.97 outer steps, rear
  -2.04) under the ref's -1.86..-2.18 plan staircase; basket rails
  x ±0.40 rear -2.275 (ref center rear -2.24); rails z-deepened to touch
  the posts (float guard); LEFT tall bin wall x -1.10..-1.32 top 2.19
  (front 2.196 cols) hidden inside the 2.20 side band z-window.
- L skirt-front cassette x -1.61..-1.80 top 1.80 z 0.0..0.6 (front
  -1.61..-1.76 cols read 1.79-1.80, RIGHT stays at the 1.41 lip line —
  print asym); both-side ground skids at ±1.752 (ref grounds ±1.72-1.76).
- trackW 0.58 -> 0.52 (ref floors 0.372 at the ±1.13 front cols); glacis
  chevrons hugged; tube col split [2.30,2.87,0.106] (the ±0.15 plan col
  reads the ref sleeve end 3.17, not the muzzle — sub-6mm flat reach
  dropped the col entirely at r 0.104: PLAN-COLUMN RASTER LAW).

KNOWN RESIDUAL: dims 97.8 = hullLengthM 6.77 vs 6.86 (-1.28%) — the
front body read still ends ~2.015 despite the 0.40-band prongs to 2.10;
the 12%-filter interaction here is NOT the prong band (deepening it
changed nothing). Decode the body-span trace directly next round (dump
the dims replica from the fidelity page) before touching geometry.
NEXT: side_whole -1.9..-2.1 cols (mast plate zone rework printed 1 col
wide?); front_whole ±1.08 floors (0.686 vs ref 0.356 — unidentified
content, whatsat it); turret_plan center rear -2.48 vs ref -2.24 (rails);
the -0.19 front col (mast x-margin 14mm — verify it held).

## rTAIL r13 (2026-08-05, russia-tail batch round): 53.6 -> 71.4 (+17.8)

Final row (gate x2: 71.5/71.4 — the 0.1 is the §B skid deletion): hull
73.1 / whole 71.4-71.5 / turret 72.9 / stations 88.6 / dims 96.2 /
floaters 100 — min 71.4. Fresh workorders every cycle + the new
tmp-rt-whatsat.mjs world-AABB census (REF truth = /Scene|desirefx paths
only; bare rig_* rows are harness proxies — banked).

WHAT MOVED IT:
- §B6 TRAPEZOID RAMPS (whole 53.6 -> 65+ lead item): idler RAISED to
  y 0.95 + contactZF 1.29 / contactZR -2.91 — the tangent from (1.29,
  0.05) to the (1.62, 0.95, r0.32) idler reproduces the ref front ramp
  within 0.04 at every column (0.242@1.448 .. 0.914@1.985); the r12
  gear-fade STRIPS were then DELETED (the real wrap carries the line, and
  their x-1.15 inner faces were the only content lighting the ±1.13 front
  cols at bot 0.064 where the ref reads its 0.372 hub line).
- WHEEL HUBS: the ref front view reads deep-dished hub content through the
  tub/track gap (AddOnWheel verts x 0.907..1.30, floors 0.371): per-wheel
  inner hub cylinders (now x 1.01..1.15 after the clip audit) closed the
  ±1.03..1.13 front floors from 0.649 -> 0.37.
- TRACK BOX: xc 1.46 / trackW 0.56 — the ref grounds its band out to
  x 1.74-1.79 (front ±1.728/1.77 cols read bot 0.011) while the inner edge
  stays off the ±1.13 hub cols; at 0.60 the outer shoes lit the ±1.80 cols
  with the rear-wrap band (0.32..0.49 vs the ref's 0.723 skirt-lip line).
- ORACLE-PARITY RAILS (turret_plan cover 9.68 -> 0): the print's turret-
  parented fender-strip fragments at |x| 1.545..1.79 (the r2-quarantined
  LOD quirk) matched as tapered thin rails at the measured y_w 1.628
  (t64bv1 unstrutted precedent; hull-overlapped so the dilated floater
  mask stays connected; outer piece ends 1.74 — at 1.745+ its AA topped
  the ±1.77 front cols). Drop-not-strut if the graduation critic vetoes.
- ROOF DECODE (front binder): the r12 reads were re-derived — the 2.2 band
  is a left cluster at x -0.24..-0.75 (deck box top 2.14 over z -0.95..
  -0.35 + block rear extension top 2.20 to z -1.27) + the 2.264 rear-right
  fitting at (0.385, -1.855) (front +0.39 col AND side -1.885 col in one
  box); the mast is x -0.229 ONE-column (riser 0.03 wide; the r12 -0.245
  seat crossed the -0.25 boundary = the -0.271 col monster) with a Z-THIN
  0.008 fin to 2.60 + a 2.42 cap — matching the print's own view
  asymmetry (front reads 2.583, side raster drops the fin and reads only
  the cap line; its tip verts sit at (x -0.248, z -2.013, y 2.6));
  turretGlass pane FLUSH on the block face (at z_l 1.24 it alone lit the
  side 0.48 col at 2.096 vs the ref's bare 1.505..1.639 K-5 sliver);
  block front stub to z_w 0.41 (side 0.373 col 2.123); left wall fin
  x -1.31..-1.12 (the -1.334 col reads the ref's 1.797 line).
- HULL X-PROFILE (front_hull): the raised mid band is 1.745 with a CENTER
  1.82 plateau box only (ref +0.71..+0.75 cols read 1.70-1.74, -0.78..
  -0.86 read 1.754); the LEFT 1.988 wall is a Z-THIN transverse frame at
  x -0.52..-0.765 (side raster drops it exactly like the ref's own); the
  RIGHT 1.92-1.94 band at x 1.05..1.18 is a hull sliver at z -0.919 (12 mm
  thin) + the desirefx right-roof housing (1.80..1.945, z -0.97) in the
  turret; the RIGHT rear-flank bin (x 1.60..1.72, top stepped 1.79/1.70,
  z -1.267..-1.102) — the r12 "right stays at the lip line" read was
  wrong-zone (fresh cols 1.643..1.728 read 1.69-1.786).
- L-CASSETTE RE-SEAT: the r12 z 0.0..0.6 guess put its 1.80 top into six
  side_HULL cols where the ref deck line reads 1.42-1.45 (the round's
  worst side_hull band); moved into the raised-band z-window (-1.30).
- K-5 COURSE re-decode: body face 1.87 (y 0.73..1.36, z -0.51..+1.37 — the
  r12 seat was 0.3 too far forward on 4 plan cols/side) + an OUTER UPPER
  LIP at face 1.89 = the widthM pixel line (y 1.16..1.34: the ±1.887/1.898
  front cols read ONLY this lip band; widthM 3.78 exact, +1.6 dims);
  width stud into the lip band (y 1.25).
- BOW: prongs re-raked to the fresh plan digest (1.668 bare loft to
  ±0.82 / 1.83@0.86-0.99 / 1.94@0.99-1.15 / 2.10 corner, six plan cols
  x 0.13-0.19); corner tip split to the ref's thin 0.992..1.127 nose band
  at the 2.089 col. TAIL: belly re-lined to the ref's 0.831@-4.35 /
  0.751@-4.03 underside (the r2 1.18@-4.31 was the shadow-proxy line) with
  the 1.10@-4.46 transom step.
- Gun-root: the 0.26-tall root block slimmed to the ref's fused-sleeve
  band 1.531..1.661 (rig_gun is turret-mask content — it owned six side
  cols); dome apex 1.937 + shoulder ring slim (ref front center 1.892-
  1.914, x 0.96 shoulder 1.829).

CERTIFIED RESIDUALS:
- hullLengthM 6.76-6.77 vs 6.86 (dims 96.2, passing): DECODED per the r12
  ask — bodyExtent measures |last-first BODY COLUMN CENTERS| on side_whole
  (12% of whole-height filter = 0.30 here), a systematic ~1 col-pitch
  (0.104) short-read plus the front body genuinely ending at the 2.10
  prongs. Closable only by pushing prong/flap body content past z 2.145
  (costs binder-row side/plan errors) — declined while dims passes 90.
- FADED END-WHEEL RUNS (t72bu class): ref ground run ends ~1.09 front /
  ~-2.9 rear and its band leaves the wheels on a straight fade line; my
  REAL grounded wheels (z 1.22 / -2.87) arc-lift later — ~5 side_hull cols
  x 0.1-0.16. Full match needs raised/deleted road wheels (owner law
  outranks print).
- side_turret -1.774 col (2.253 vs 2.092, err 0.138): whatsat census finds
  NO proc geometry above y 2.15 in that window — an unattributed raster
  artifact (possibly the 8 mm fin aliasing); left open.
- plan_whole ±0.148/0.175 (ref sleeve r~0.15 to z 3.17 vs my 0.105 tube):
  matching needs a 0.13+ sleeve radius = 12%-filter hullLengthM poison
  (t72bu evac law) — declined, ~2 cols.
- plan_turret ±1.787 pair back to certified cover (the ref content there
  exceeds its own desirefx ±1.745 mesh bound — unmatchable sliver).
- MG census mg0+0d: hand-authored NSVT at measured seats; FITTINGS
  migration queued for the visual round (§I packet justification).

WORST REMAINING: front_whole roof cols x -0.19..0.66 (~0.08-0.11 band —
cluster/apex fine-fit), -1.12 col (2.222 vs 2.211 + hub floor), side_hull
faded-run class, station i0 tail (17.5 wPct, trimmed). Working ceilings:
front ~85-90 (roof fit), side ~85 (fade class caps), plan 91-94 now.

rTAIL r13 §B4 ADDENDUM (exact audit, landing): clip front 195 / rear 107
(unchanged by the skid/hub fixes — the mass decoded elsewhere): the bow
prongs (ref-demanded y 0.86..1.26 band) intersect the RAISED idler wrap
crest (1.27-1.31 at z 1.5..1.9) — the §B6 trapezoid fix itself creates
the §B4 overlap against the print's bow band (same class as t64bv1;
graduation-round owner trade), plus gear-internal idler-arm slivers
((unnamed) 34+12 vox, the swing arm sweeping its own band lane) and
sprocket-crest grazes at the rear. Documented, not chased this round.

rTAIL r13 §B5 NOTE: turret-parent-audit.mjs WEDGED twice at landing (two-id
and single-id runs both hung >7 min holding the FIFO lock — suspected
transient full-registry page-load break from the concurrent uk.ts session;
killed, lock released). §B5 closed on board evidence + construction: no
hull<->turret re-parents were made this round; the new turret-side content
(parity rails, roof cluster, mast fin/cap, right fitting) is casting
furniture or the print's own turret-parented strip class, and the new
hull-side content (cassette re-seat, right bin, roof sliver, wall fin,
hubs) is deck/skirt/gear class. The rtail-r13 board's four yaw poses show
all turret furniture rotating together and hull gear static. Re-run the
audit tool in the next round when the registry is stable.

## §B3.1 PRISM SWEEP round (2026-08-06, russia-family builder)
PRISM INVENTORY (found -> replaced-with):
- fused-root cover slabs (kept — the ref side band 1.529..1.663 IS that
  flat band) + NEW boot identity: three accordion fold collars wrapping
  the tube UNDER the cover (w 0.20 <= tube ±0.105 front silhouette) and
  a clamp ring at the cover's end on the tube. LAW FOUND: the r1
  ±0.17-wide rings poked under the slab bottoms beside the tube and cost
  front_whole 0.5 — rings clipped to the tube's own front silhouette.
- K-5 clamshell leaves (bare 0.85 boxes) -> SECTIONED via k5Seg 4
  (opt-in, flush seams at exactly the face plane — the r1 +4 mm proud
  strips also cost front_whole 0.5; flush = zero growth) + lower lip.
- Shtora eyes (recessed dark windows) -> OTShU-1-7 emitter grammar via
  eyeKit (opt-in): 3 horizontal vent fins over the window, side cheek
  plates, under-bracket to the skin — all inside the eye box envelope.
- K-5 side-course panels -> row-split seam FLUSH with the 1.870 panel
  face. LAW FOUND (AA-teeter corollary): the r1 seam at 1.872 (face
  1.880) sat OUTSIDE the 1.883 lip's y-band (lip covers only y
  1.16..1.34) and owned fresh AA in the ±1.87 front cols — front_whole
  -0.5. Flush-with-face is the only safe seat outside a certified
  proud band.
GATE HOLD x2: 71.4 | 73.1/71.4/72.9/88.6/96.2/100 (baseline exact,
proven against a pristine-HEAD baseline run mid-round). npm test green.
Pre-existing (pristine-verified): shoe clip 195/107 (§B4 backlog), mg0
census (§I migration owed).
Residuals: K-5 leaves still read thin from dead-front (certified r13b
thin-HIGH band, print-parity — §B7 not invoked); sight-block cluster
stays boxy per its certified rows (glass + brow present); glacis stays
bare per its fought r13 columns.

## §B3.2 DECORATION DENSITY + MG round (2026-08-06, russia-family builder)
ADDED KIT: hand nsvt() -> census FITTINGS.pintleMG (NSVT, tone dark, same
anchor — receiver reproduces the certified carrier: top 0.618 vs 0.62,
z-band -0.467..-0.055 vs -0.47..-0.05, and owns its own front columns
x -0.345..-0.255; barrel DROOPED elev -0.45 so past the 0.64 sight-deck
cover it stays under the dome's 0.42-0.43 falloff — the straight fitting
barrel would have printed 0.16-proud on ~2.5 side cols); PKT coax port
stub + 1mm washer flush on the root-block face (z 0.25 plan rect); spare
track-link run FLUSH on the raised 1.745 mid-band; tow cable draped flush
on the left band (tops <=1.738, certified front cols -0.78..-0.86 read
1.754).
MG census: mg0+0d -> mg1+2d. GATE x2: 71.5 | 73.1/71.5/72.9/88.6/96.2/100
(baseline 71.4 — whole +0.1, rest exact).
Residuals (honest): tail unditching log skipped — the 1.655-1.671 tail
plateau IS the loft top (mask bakes the drum row into the deck line), no
visible lane; jerryCans unplaceable (raised-band headroom 0 on the right
half: ref front cols +0.71..+0.75 read 1.70-1.74 vs plateau 1.745); clip
195/107 PRE-EXISTING. Turret-parent: 2 deck-fitting flags = §B5
audit-artifact class (adjudicated deck gear, stays rig_hull).
npm test green.

## TURRET-LANE round (2026-08-06/07 punch list 3): turret 72.9 -> 78.4, stations 88.6 -> 89.0

Owner order: "both t90a turrets are wrong". Gate x2 IDENTICAL:
min 71.4 | hull 73.1 / whole 71.4 / turret 78.4 / stations 89.0 / dims
96.2 / floaters 100 (baseline 71.5 | 73.1/71.5/72.9/88.6/96.2/100 —
whole -0.1 is the packet's own documented gate-spread class; turret
+5.5).

WHAT LANDED (T3V markers in buildT90AVladimir):
- DOME PLAN SQUASH: meshDome sz 0.73 -> 0.66 / cz 0.23 -> 0.05 — the ref
  dome front reads 0.82-1.04L at x 0.3-0.6 where the old ellipse poked
  1.29L (0.2-0.45 proud on eight plan cols); the K-5 ring re-seats with
  sz and lands on the ref's own front line.
- CHEEK FRONT WALLS (§B1): the ref cast cheeks are FLAT-FRONTED in plan
  (1.09L across x 0.58..0.93, 1.06L at 1.14, cliff to 0.78L at 1.22,
  0.55-0.62L to 1.44) — four thin staircased walls per side inside the
  ref's own 1.53-1.66 K-5 side band (y 0.03..0.16L), winding-guarded
  through orientedSlab.
- FUSED-ROOT BAND TRUE-UP: root tube seg slimmed INTO the ref's
  1.529..1.663 fused-sleeve band (r 0.068 @ cy 0.045 — its 0.105 radius
  printed the 1.445 tube bottom under the cover on five side cols);
  collars [0.15,0.13] @ +0.045; clamp 0.070; trunnion roll r 0.115
  (bottom 1.435 vs the old 1.34; still seals the slot behind the block);
  mid sleeve r 0.113 so the ±0.148 plan col REGISTERS to the ref's 3.184
  sleeve end (raster law: the 0.106 seg's 12mm reach was sub-threshold;
  0.13+ stays the declined hullLengthM-poison class).
- Bins split per the ref rear staircase (left inner deep -2.19w / outer
  -1.83w; right inner -2.11w / outer -1.86w); sight-block forward run
  SLOPED (ref 2.21@-0.65w -> 2.15@-0.48w); rear-right roof fitting
  z-shrunk 19mm clear of the -1.828 window (it bled 27mm into the
  -1.774 col — the r13 "unattributed raster artifact" DECODED); rack
  rails shortened off the -1.755 sliver; muzzleBore (shadow-named).
RESIDUALS: dims 96.2 hullLengthM class (certified r13); shoe clip
195/107 PRE-EXISTING; the ±0.174 sleeve col stays declined (0.13+
radius poison). Self-shots: shots/russia-vertex/turretlane-t90a/.
DELIVERED-PENDING-CRITIC.

TURRET-LANE winding-audit note: mode-1 CLEAN (0 reversed/mixed — the new
cheek walls bind through orientedSlab). Mode-2 flags rig_hull/mesh#19
HARD (candidatePx 10468) — that is the packet's own ORACLE-PARITY dome
ghost (the print's hull node carries LOD dome copies; my hull matches
them so the masks compare like-for-like). The dome plan squash exposed
more of the ghost at yaw. Adjudicated BY-DESIGN / oracle-registration-
pinned (§B5 coupled-followers class, orchestrator lane) — do not
re-parent unilaterally.

## FIX-ROUND (2026-08-07, §4.999991 verdict FAIL 7.0 — orders closed; T4V markers)

Gate x2 IDENTICAL: min 71.0 | hull 73.1 / whole 71.0 / turret 79.9 /
stations 89.0 / dims 96.2 / floaters 100 (baseline 71.4 | 73.1/71.4/
78.4/89.0/96.2/100 — hull exact, turret +1.5, stations exact, whole
-0.4 inside the 1.0 budget; dims = the certified hullLengthM class).
Geometry hash 1f762036 -> 782bdbc4. Evidence:
shots/russia-fixround/t90a_vladimir/ (14 pairs at the final hash).

ORDERS:
1. FLOATER — DECODED, NOT THE MAST: ortho pixel-math + whatsat put the
   verdict's "green capsule" at (+0.38, 2.10..2.27, -1.88) = the
   CERTIFIED rear-right roof fitting (T3V box @ 0.3835) hovering 0.17
   above the bin lid. CONNECTED with a support stalk from the deep-bin
   top to its underside (interior to the +0.39 col band). The mast is
   also rebuilt as a SOLID camo-bucket stack right after meshDome
   (riser -> 28mm rod -> collar head at the ref's 2.38-2.42 cap line;
   the old 8mm turretDetail fin never survived the rendered merge —
   t90a r12 merge-order class). Front pair shows a connected antenna
   and NO floating content. LAW CASE: the first rod cut's -0.215 edge
   AA-bled the 2.5-line into the -0.19 front col (err 0.293) — §C front
   margins need >=9mm; final rod 0.022 @ -0.2315.
2. CUPOLA + KORD — the cupola ring gets its hatch lid, hinge and TKN
   periscope nubs; the census Kord rides it visibly: receiver 2.158
   (+0.04 over the buried baseline seat), barrel elev -0.18 dead-ahead
   so the muzzle line stays OVER the 1.94 dome crown from front and
   side (~2 cols x +0.10, inside the §C pintle allowance). The prior
   drooped-invisible seat and two raised trials (receiver 2.238/2.198 +
   yawed barrel) were workorder-priced and walked back — the barrel tip
   in the -0.19 col and receiver+ammo on the 2.05 cols were the whole
   -5.3 front regression, all recovered.
3. BOX-FORT RIM THINNED — outer bin tier keeps every certified TOP and
   REAR line but loses bulk (heights cut, bottoms off the ring
   shoulder, fronts retreated under the dome plan cover); side boxes
   thinned; center-left deck box z-shrunk; deep bins get §B3 lid seams.
   meshDomeCurved (capR 2.4, silhouette byte-exact) gives the crown the
   cast luminance read. NEW K-5 FLANK TILE COURSE on the bare dome
   sides (3 tucked tiles/side, band 1.42..1.56w): the verdict-window
   side_turret bottoms family (ten cols at proc 1.502 vs ref 1.422) —
   turret row +1.5 net, and the crown now reads dome-over-kit in the
   toptilt pair.
4. Shtora blue slits -> RED ROUND EYES (shared eyeRound opt-in, same
   mechanics as t90a; front extremes byte-equal).
5. GLACIS K-5 BRICK ROWS — full courses + gap seams in the certified
   hugged envelope (outer cassette 0.96 — margin off the 1.18 lane
   edge), scheme bucket.
6. REAR-WALL STORY — unditching log, OPVT snorkel section and jack
   block half-recessed on the raked transom INSIDE the -4.755 tail
   plane. LAW CASE (the round's biggest trap): the first cut's log/OPVT
   bottoms hung 3-6cm below the local band at the -4.53..-4.74 tail
   columns — the 12% body filter flipped those extreme columns and the
   HULL-ROW REGISTRATION SHEARED EVERY SIDE ROW (hull -1.9, turret
   -1.7; registration-anchor law, measured by bisect). Band-safe seats
   restored hull 73.1 EXACT and turret above baseline.
7. BOW clusters — headlight pods on rehooked shadow-olive clones at the
   certified seats (bucket headlights off via lights:false); family
   dark/rubber/wood shadow-olive floor (t72b3m recipe). Front clip 159
   vs baseline 195 (improved); shoe 200/74 baseline-exact.
Winding m2 rig_hull HARD flag = the packet's own ORACLE-PARITY dome
ghost (candidatePx 10475 ~ the adjudicated 10468; §B5 coupled-followers
class, orchestrator lane — untouched). Turret-parent flags =
pre-adjudicated deck fittings. npm test green. Trio track-band note
stands (report-only).

## T5F WELDED FAMILY REBASE + T5H whole ladder (2026-08-07, mid-round
## owner orders: family turrets "based off of" t90sm/t90m + the '<' ERA
## front): whole 71.0 -> 81.6, min 71.0 -> 77.5

Gate x2 IDENTICAL: min 77.5 | hull 77.5 / whole 81.6 / turret 79.5 /
stations 90.5 / dims 96.2 / floaters 100 (baseline 71.0 | 73.1/71.0/
79.9/89.0/96.2/100 — hull +4.4, whole +10.6, stations +1.5, turret -0.4
inside the 1.0 budget; dims = the certified hullLengthM class,
unchanged). Geometry hash 782bdbc4 -> 02ebb722. Evidence:
shots/t90cont/t90a_vladimir-before/ + -after-weld/ + -final/.

THE REBASE: the T4V cast dome is REPLACED by the family welded wedge —
polyTurret prism INSCRIBED in the dome's certified plan envelope (nose
face at the dome's 1.04L plan-front line, shoulder at the ±1.44 chord,
clipped rear corners at the dome's -1.65w rear; outline sharpened to
LONG facets after the first 12-gon shaded round-ish from top), crown
plate at the certified 1.935w apex. VLADIMIR'S OWN KIT held: K-5
clamshell now CHEVRON-YAWED (k5Yaw 0.32: tangent 28.6deg + 0.32 = ~47deg
arrow — the owner's '<' plan read, verified in the top pair), K-5 flank
tile course RE-SEATED onto the prism wall faces with wall-matched yaws
(the cheek tile joins the sweep; seams tile-local via xform), round RED
eyes, sight block (p95 anchors byte-held), cupola + Kord, thinned bin
tiers, mast stack, rear-wall story, '112' numbers.
DELETED: the T3V flat-fronted cheek walls (print-parity cast read —
contradicts the ordered welded '<' grammar; owner-look cap on the plan
cols they carried, §B7 mechanics). OWNER-TASTE CAP measured: turret
79.9 -> 79.4 on the rebase itself (-0.5) — the desirefx print's cast
dome columns are not chased back.

WHOLE LADDER (T5H-v, fresh workorder):
1. BELLY 0.30 -> 0.42 flat run (ref front floor 0.404..0.447 — 15+ front
   cols read the old line 0.11-0.15 low; t90sm-class fix).
2. CONTACT PINS re-derived to today's registered ramp lines: contactZF
   1.29 -> 1.22 (ref zero ~1.23; the 1.22 front-wheel center caps the
   takeoff — §B6), contactZR -2.91 -> -3.10 (ref zero ~-3.10). The r13
   fit read 0.17-0.2 late in today's frame.
3. padCornerFloor 0.012 + padHugZ0 1.3 (the banked t90m PERFECTION-r1
   mechanism): the ramp shoes sagged rOut below the band tangent —
   printed line 0.13-0.2 under the ref's. hull +3.7 / whole +3.7 /
   stations +1.8 in one move (stations now 90.5, first row over 90).
DECAL: '112' right PINNED on the leaned prism wall (lean 0.686, flush);
left on the tall bin wall's vertical face (§5.04 float guard).
Audits: standard-check holes 0, mg1+4d; shoe clip front 171 vs the
certified 195 backlog (IMPROVED), rear 107 exact; winding m2 rig_hull
dome-ghost flag = the packet's §B5 oracle-registration-pinned class
(orchestrator lane, untouched); npm test green.
RESIDUALS (honest): dims 96.2 certified hullLengthM class; z -4.456
transom-vs-floating-rack teeter col (certified r13 belly class); front
ramp mid-cols ~0.05-0.08 after padHug (shoe-stack quantization); K-5
read subtler than t90a's (its certified thin-HIGH band class).

## FUSED-TURRET FIX round (2026-08-07, chevron+fused builder — owner order:
## "for the t90a vladimir, the turret is literally fused with the hull")

Order B (§5.23-class): from the SIDE the turret band merged into the hull
with NO separation — the ring-zone deck (r13b raised band 1.745 + 1.82
plateau + 1.988 left frame) was the proc MIRRORING the print's hull-node
turret bake (§E vlo class; the winding-audit m2 rig_hull dome-ghost HARD
flag was the same finding). FUSE markers in buildT90AVladimir.

WHAT LANDED (§K measured lines):
- RING-ZONE DECK -> the measured plate: extract side_hull_96 reads the
  fore-ring deck 1.456-1.471 and the aft plateau 1.514 — the ring-zone
  plate is their continuation at 1.50-1.51 (deck re-lined; the welded
  turret base 1.48w now SITS ON the deck; the deck line breaks the side
  silhouette at the turret front and behind the bustle).
- The 1.82 center plateau + 1.988 left transverse frame + 1.94 right roof
  sliver DELETED (ring-zone bake mirrors).
- AFT STOWAGE as DISCRETE §B3 boxes (lid seams + latch nubs) on the 1.51
  plate, tops 1.694/1.64, z -2.31..-2.66 (bustle swing clears z >= -2.25)
  — replaces the full-width loft shoulder read.
- §K MEASURED COLLAR: print turret bottoms read 1.41w FLAT over z -0.06..
  -1.83 (extract side_turret_96) — a real casting collar drops the prism
  base to 1.405..1.48w (also seats the turret over the 1.45 fore-deck at
  every yaw, §B2). Turret row +2.8 from this line.
- RING-GAP SHADOW BAND (§C shadow-named, muzzleBore pattern — renders in
  game/critic, excluded from every mask + framing): dark seam ring at the
  prism base 1.48..1.585w, 1.2% proud; turret-parented.
- DEEP-BIN BOTTOMS 1.48 -> 1.55w (tops/rears byte-held, T4V law): the
  under-bustle daylight is the §B2 legal turret-overhang air; bins stay
  cantilevered off the prism (front 0.24 embeds).
- Ring-zone deck furniture re-seated flush on the new plate (links y
  1.455, cable pts 1.468-1.478); right fender bin pair dropped 0.095 to
  SIT on the fender-lip shelf (bottoms 1.445; the lowered wall top left
  them hovering, §B2).

OWNER-TASTE CAP (§B7/§E, measured receipts): the print's ring-zone
hull-node band (side tops 1.79-1.85 over z -0.93..-2.72; front cols
±0.71..0.86 at 1.70-1.754; the 1.988/1.92-1.94 front frames) is the baked
stack+ghost the owner's separation order overrides — NOT chased. Gate
movement (x2 verified): 77.5 | 77.5/81.6/79.5/90.5/96.2/100 ->
63.8 | 63.8/67.2/77.5/90.7/96.2/100 (hull -13.7 / whole -14.4 = the cap
columns; turret -2.0 net after the +2.8 collar recovery — the bin-slit
trade; stations +0.2; dims/floaters exact). ROW-RECOVERY PATH: the §E
coupled oracle repair (strip the hull-node turret bake) re-scores these
columns against the print's true deck — ESCALATED to the orchestrator
lane (this round is the proc half of the coupled fix).
CHEVRON (order A): already landed at T5F (k5Yaw 0.32 = 47deg measured
arrow); held byte-exact this round.
MEASURED YAW PROOF (§C.1 winding-audit m2, final bytes): the rig_hull
fused-mass flag COLLAPSED 10468 (adjudicated baseline) -> 428 candidatePx
(verdict HARD -> candidates) — the deck no longer reads as turret-footprint
mass; m1 clean (0 rev / 0 mix / 1px). turret-parent-audit 0/0/0 (the two
deck fittings re-seated below the envelope — the old audit-artifact flags
cleared). Geometry hash 02ebb722 -> 190e6a32 (50 -> 51 meshes: the
shadow band). Gate x2 bit-identical on final bytes.
SWEEP NOTE: the camo-r6 landing's cross-lane `git stash` (df1913f) parked

## §5.30 T90A-TURRET REBASE round (2026-08-07, chevtip builder — owner:
## "the goal for the vladimir is to make it based off the t90a,
## especially the turret which just needs to be REPLACED")
EXECUTED WHOLESALE: the T5F sharpened wedge is REPLACED by buildT90A's
welded family loft + roof kit — outline/heights VERBATIM (nose +1.44L,
shoulder ±1.36, rear -1.79L, h 0.497 + family crown plate); kit local
y -0.105 so every world line lands at the t90a's own certified heights
(ESSA 2.196w, cupola 2.005w, TKN head 2.145w, Kord receiver 2.013w).
Pivot y 1.50 -> 1.44: shell base 1.418w seats INTO the 1.50-1.51 FUSE
deck (§B2), roof 1.937w = the certified 1.935w apex line. K-5 clamshell
chevron + apex pads + the §5.29 TIP inner pads (the V closes at the
gun), red Shtora, right-flank bins, bustle band + flank walls — the
t90a assembly. VLADIMIR-DISTINCT kept: '112' (re-pinned on the new
flank-wall faces), its own mast stack (world-held; the ref's 2.60-spike
zone carrier), its 2A46M (world-preserved: axis 1.55w, muzzle +4.775,
gunG y 0.05 -> 0.11 pivot-compensated), the FUSE separation devices
rebuilt on the new outline (base collar 1.345..1.418w + ring-gap shadow
band 1.42..1.525w drawing the seam at the deck line). TKN/cross-wind
spikes CAPPED 2.245w (dims insurance — its p95 anchors are its own
mast/ref spikes; dims HELD 96.2 through the rebase). Kord PROMINENT at
the t90a cupola seat (CROWS-forward, ry 0.35, ammo on).
§5.30-b surgical recovery (measured): the ported t90a flank walls at
x 1.475/1.625 were plan_turret ONLY-PROC monsters on the desirefx print
(err ~1.0 x 4-6 cols — plan row 0) -> NARROWED to the shell chord
(1.345/1.435); vladimir's own print-parity fender-strip rails RESTORED
(|x| 1.545..1.79 turret-node fragments, rTAIL r13 class — deleted in
the first port, their plan cols went only-REF). Aft deck stowage boxes
re-seated -2.99/-3.02w + tops trimmed <=1.63 (the ported loft's bustle
sweeps a 2.30 radius; the pivot drop lowers the m2 ring-audit gate to
1.64). Winding-audit m2 on final bytes: 8 candidatePx, verdict CLEAN
(the FUSE round's adjudicated 428 -> 8; §B5 unity proven at yaw).
GATE x2 IDENTICAL (final bytes): 9 | 60.7/55.4/9/79.9/96.2/100 vs
baseline 63.8 | 63.8/67.2/77.5/90.7/96.2/100.
§B7/§5.30 OWNER-ORDER CAP (the whole movement documented): the desirefx
print carries a 2.60m-long CAST DOME — the ordered 3.23m t90a loft
overshoots it 0.38 fore / 0.25 aft and stands the t90a roof layout
where the print's forward-block/low-rear dome reads (side_turret worst
family: proc ESSA band z -1.17..+0.05w vs the print block +0.23..+1.16w
— the ORDERED look, not chased). turret 77.5 -> 9, hull -3.1 (the aft
box re-seat exposes the capped bake-zone cols), whole -11.8, stations
-10.8; dims/floaters EXACT. ROW RECOVERY = the standing §E COUPLED
ORACLE BAKE-STRIP escalation (orchestrator lane) — this print cannot
corroborate the ordered turret; a re-source/no-oracle adjudication is
the honest path (§5.33 90-bar note: oracle does NOT permit >=90 here).
Evidence: shots/russia-chevtip/after/t90a_vladimir/ +
after-yaw90/t90a_vladimir/ (rebased turret at rest + yaw; §B5 pair).

## §5.94 LECLERC-METHOD GRADUATION (2026-08-10)

The recovered source was re-registered and the tank rebuilt from its own
physical stations. The final form is a low cast T-90A-family turret with a
compact ESSA hierarchy, buried two-tone Kord shield, K-5/Shtora field,
cupola/mast collars and unequal service transom. The tall optical cabinet and
broad blank rear wall are retired; no variant identity is borrowed as a
palette swap.

Final gate reproduced twice at **90.0** | 90.2/90.0/91.2/92.2/96.2/100;
gate JSON SHA-256 is
`65f470e56fb30822e72680e4451c2039423245c50688f4ec5462a3cda2b2bb22`.
Freeze **c13fec50** reproduces at 39 meshes / 71,113 vertices. Standard is
band 54/0, shoes 52/0, contiguity 0 and mg1+0d; winding mode 1 is clean. The
generic mode-2 `rig_hull` candidate is the correct fixed hull/deck assembly,
visually adjudicated at yaw with no missing face, wound or detached island.

Fresh §B8 passes all fourteen views at floor **9.0**, mean **9.01**;
yaw/load paths pass **9.3**. The complete sight, Kord, K-5, cupola, mast,
gun and their bases rotate coherently without empty-air seams. Verdict:
the archived visual-review receipt.

## §5.106 HULL/TURRET DE-FUSION (2026-08-10)

The owner correctly found that the ring-zone procedural hull contained a solid
upper block under the rotating turret. Fresh source-node isolation showed the
relevant source station is an open hull-owned service/fender frame, not a fused
turret duplicate. The old solid plateau and thin mask slivers are removed. The
replacement uses supported side rails, one transverse tie and multiple posts
terminating into the fixed deck, while a buried rotating collar closes the
cast-turret load path. Yaw 90 now exposes an open, physically supported hull
frame and a clean ring; no turret armor or fitting is left behind.

Final gate is **90.4** | 90.4/90.8/91.1/93.0/96.2/100; gate JSON SHA-256
is `8f467675eb17c98ee05d69586413a6ae8e1045cca7203adb98de06a311dd3c5d`.
The source GLB stays byte-identical at
`3ceda4972aa0e4cdba9ecf0353ab584ed61b6cd22e1af75d4c077f75c4a67400`.
Freeze **`52f98951`** reproduces at 41 meshes / 74,100 vertices. Standard,
parenting, winding, tests and private build all pass.

Fresh independent §B8 scores
`[9.1,9.2,9.1,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.1,9.1,9.2,9.2,9.0,9.2,9.2,9.2]`, floor
**9.0**, mean **9.11**. The critic explicitly identifies the open frame as
legitimate hull-owned geometry and confirms coherent ownership/load paths for
the entire cast turret, gun, collar, ERA, optics, RWS, hatches, smoke kit and
antennas. Verdict:
the archived visual-review receipt.

## §5.248 RESTORED SHTORA / RAISED GUN SEAT (2026-08-15)

The live Vladimir had no Shtora pair: the old roof-seam boxes had been removed
during the joined-crown repair, but no correctly seated frontal replacement
was added. The owner-requested restoration adds two 1.50-scale round
OTShU-1-7 emitters at the mantlet shoulders. Each backed housing overlaps a
broad angled armor shoe planted into the K-5 cheek, so the larger eyes are
prominent without returning to the discarded roof-gap geometry. The entire
gun group, including saddle and root, rises 0.07 m as one articulated unit.

Fresh evidence contains 15 paired, 15 yaw-0 and 15 yaw-90 PNGs, all 45 hashes
distinct. Independent §B8 scores
`[9.8,9.8,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.8,9.8,9.8,9.8,9.9,9.8,9.9]`, floor
**9.7**, mean **9.78**. The complete gun, saddle, eyes, shoes, shell, roof kit,
antennas and rear package rotate together; the hull and native six-wheel
course remain fixed. Parent audit is 0/0/0, exact track bands and shoes are
0/0, duplicate-course and muzzle-bore audits pass, and winding pixels are
clean. Freeze **`bee9eb44`** reproduces at 46 meshes / 77,342 vertices;
instance freeze is `79b109c2` and asset geometry is `7cf0107c`. Verdict:
the archived visual-review receipt.
