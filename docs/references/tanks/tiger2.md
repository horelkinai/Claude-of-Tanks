## Identity cues

- Long low hull with one huge 50° glacis plate full width, upper hull sides
  vertical (~3.27 m over the sponsons) inside wider track guards (3.755 m).
- Series Henschel turret: narrow flat front plate, sides sloped inward and
  splaying rearward in plan, long overhanging bustle, curved-base Saukopf-less
  mantlet collar (Turmzielfernrohr port right), drum cupola LEFT-forward, rear
  hatch. Turret side bins/track hangers on many vehicles.
- 8.8 L/71: huge overhang, sleeve step mid-tube, double-baffle brake.
- Overlapped Schachtellaufwerk with steel-tired wheels (dished style, 2 rows),
  front sprocket, exhaust pair with armored bases on the tail plate.

## Local GLB oracle notes

Path: `public/models/tanks/community/tiger2-maximus.glb` (20 flat sibling
meshes; turret `^Object_2$` = turret+gun fused; explicit pivot). Frame is
REAR-SHIFTED (full-box centering incl. the L/71). Width-normalized probe
(scale 0.963):

- hull z −4.95..+2.24 (7.19), roof 1.86, glacis 1.29@z1.94 → fender line
  1.81@z1.64; engine deck 1.88–1.97 (z −3.46..−4.06), tail 1.17..1.82@−4.66;
  tracks ±1.82, fender band ±1.88 (y 1.0–1.4), upper hull ±1.55 at y 1.5
  tapering to ±1.28 at y 1.9. Ground contact z ≈ 1.0..−3.3.
- ORACLE RIG DEFECT: several hull-parented meshes (mantlet collar at
  z 0.4–1.05 to y 2.5, cupola drum at z −1.06..−1.66 to y 3.03, aerials at
  z −2.2..−3.2 to y 2.8) belong on the turret/gun — they do NOT yaw with
  Object_2. The procedural build parents them correctly (cupola on turret,
  collar on gun), knowingly sacrificing a few hull/turret component points
  against the mis-parented reference masks (is3_bergman rule: identity wins).
- turret (fused w/ gun): shell z +0.44..−2.1, plan front ±0.63 @ z 0.3
  splaying to ±1.29 @ z −1.35..−1.5, bustle tail bins to −3.0 (±0.54..0.70);
  side base y 1.86, roof rises 2.6@0.14 → 3.03 crown @ −1.06..−1.66 (that
  crown IS the cupola band), rear roof 2.57@−1.96; front profile sides slope
  ±1.29 @ y 1.9 → ±0.80 @ y 3.0.
- gun: axis y ≈ 2.26, tube Ø0.18–0.24, muzzle z +4.94 (2.70 m past the bow).

ORACLE CAP (documented after 3 revisions): the maximus print's rig is
mis-parented — the mantlet collar (z 0.44..1.04, to y 2.5), the cupola-height
band (z −1.06..−1.66, to y 3.03) and the aerials (z −2.2..−3.2) live in HULL
meshes that do not yaw with Object_2. The component masks subtract them from
the reference's turret and credit them to its hull, so a correctly-rigged
procedural (cupola/collar on the yawing turret/gun, per the m1a1_aim lesson)
is structurally capped near T≈55/H≈84 while the whole-view silhouettes sit at
87-96. Identity wins over the metric; whole-mask overall is 89.7.


## Geometry gate v9 (2026-07-31, from-scratch agent)

v9 iteration on the batch-3-repaired oracle: added the print's hull-side
deep-wading intake tower over the rear deck (hull mask carries a 2.5-2.8 m
mass at z -2.1..-3.4 world), steeper lower nose, hull side plates, KwK43 to
published overall (repaired oracle still short: 9.93 vs 10.29), fenders
1.83. min 0 -> 26.3 (hull 26.3, whole 30.8, stations 68.8, dims 63.3).
ORACLE-REPAIR CANDIDATES: (a) the intake-tower mass belongs turret-side or
not at all — verify against the print; (b) the front suspension sits high
(ground contact only from z ~ +0.9 world — nose-up rake, rigid-transform
repairable); (c) dims 63.3 is heightM 3.04 + hullLength 7.25 vs 7.38 —
lengthen the tub to 7.38 measured next pass.


## Geometry gate v10 round-2 cert update (2026-07-31, oracle batch 7)
Batch-7 vertex analysis DISPROVED the v9 "nose-up rake" candidate: the
print's track-bottom profile is dead flat (y 0.000..0.003 over 4.2 m ~= the
published 4.1 m contact). The REAL defect is the print's track loop being
authored ~0.6 m SHORT (front wheel curve starts ~0.4 m early) — a PRINT
CAP, not rigid-repairable; my published-geometry track loop carries the
residual side-row bottom-line error against it. The 2.8 m intake tower IS
verified genuine hull geometry (deep-wading tower, 38 mm under the turret
swing) — the hull-side replication stays (round 2 reshaped it to the
measured 2.66-2.74 crown and raised the belly to the print's 0.49 line).
Round-2 row: hull 42.6 whole 47.4 turret 29.2 stations 60 dims 97.8
floaters 100 (v9/ledger: 26/30.2/30.1/68.4/63.3/100). Dims closed by
front/rear mud-flap hullLengthM anchors + the turret mound cap plate at
published heightM 3.09 (p95).
NEW CERTIFIED PRINT CAP — turretCurves: the print's fused gun line sits at
plan x ~ -0.17 (one column left of centre; my sim-owned gun is centered):
the two gun plan columns read ~2.1-2.3 m of asymmetric band error and own
the plan p95 (21.8%) -> turret_plan ceiling ~30-45 until an oracle gun
recenter is sanctioned. turret_side 59.9 is live (bustle/bin iteration).
