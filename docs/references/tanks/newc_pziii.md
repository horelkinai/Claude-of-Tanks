# Panzer III Ausf. J (`newc_pziii`) — reference packet

**Exact variant modeled:** Panzerkampfwagen III Ausf. J (late, 5 cm KwK 39
L/60), 1941–42 production — the long-gun J the Newc42 low-poly oracle carries
(its tube overhangs the bow ~0.7 m, which only the L/60 does).

## Identity cues

- Boxy hull with near-vertical superstructure sides slightly proud over the
  tracks; flat fender line with tools/jack; stepped bow (tracks lead).
- Turret: rounded-front faceted sides, external mantlet block, side crew
  hatches, drum cupola at turret rear center (oracle crown 2.55).
- 5 cm L/60 with a slim tube, sleeve step at the root.
- 6 small wheels low under the flat fender, 3 return rollers, front sprocket.
- Rear deck with twin louvre banks; rear exhaust muffler across the tail.

## Local GLB oracle notes

Path: `public/models/tanks/community/pziii_newc42.glb` (CC0, Newc42;
turret `^Turret$`, gun `^Gun$`). Healthy. Width-normalized probe (scale 0.969):

- hull z −2.695..+2.695 (5.39), roof plateau 1.66–1.72, glacis falls
  1.52→1.12 over z 1.67..2.67; fenders ±1.45 at y 1.1–1.4; tracks ±1.43;
  tail drops to y 0.92 at z −2.58. Ground contact z ≈ 1.6..−1.5.
- turret z +1.17..−1.33: base y 1.65, roof 2.19–2.27, cupola crown 2.55 at
  z −0.08..−0.58; rear bin arm 1.83..2.3 at z −0.83..−1.33; plan max ±0.89
  (z 0.15–0.6) tapering to ±0.30 at −1.2.
- gun: axis y ≈ 1.98, mantlet block ±0.88..0.98 at z 0.9–1.2, sleeve step
  ±0.21 (z 1.5–1.65), tube ±0.16 to muzzle z 3.415 (0.72 past bow).

## Mismatch log (before → after)

| Date | total | minView | H | T | G | R | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-30 | 68.6 | — | 89 | 52 | 0 | 80 | baseline (short L/42-ish gun never cleared the bow → gun mask 0) |
| 2026-07-30 | 88.9 | 88.6 | 90 | 81 | 97 | 86 | bespoke build: oracle-frame hull, faceted turret w/ rear-center tall cupola + Rommelkiste, L/60 clearing the bow 0.72 m (G 0→97), 6 rubber wheels + 3 return rollers + front sprocket, visor/MG ball/hatches/tools/muffler |

Remaining gap: turret 81 — the oracle's cupola blends into its roof as one
low-poly lump; the front cheek step (low wings at z 0.8–1.05) approximates its
sloped-face read within ~6 cm.


## Geometry gate v9 (2026-07-31, from-scratch agent)

Gun x +0.12 (print turret rest yaw - repair candidate; also its gun rests
visibly ELEVATED: whole-curve gun-line ~0.5 m high at the muzzle columns -
rotate the Gun node's rest pitch to zero in the repair batch). turret
43.9 -> 67. min 28.7 -> 31.2 (whole-limited by the elevated oracle gun).


## Geometry gate v10 round-2 cert update (2026-07-31, oracle batch 7)
The v9 cert ("gun x +0.12 print turret rest yaw; gun rests visibly ELEVATED
~0.5 m — rotate the Gun node's rest pitch to zero") is DOUBLE-DISPROVEN by
vertex + runtime analysis (tools/repair_oracles.py batch 7, no-recipe entry):
- rest PITCH is ZERO (tube centroid line level to the millimetre);
- rest YAW is ZERO (shell facet azimuth -0.045 deg, plan centres -0.007);
- the gun-x offset is REAL but authored INSIDE the fused Gun mesh (+0.06 raw
  off the mantlet's own centre, amplified to +0.10 visible by modelLoader's
  1.5x gun scale). Any rigid node move trades tube error for mantlet error
  1:1 — the file is byte-identical and the offset is a DOCUMENTED PRINT CAP.
Build keeps gun x +0.12 to match the runtime-amplified tube line (this is
mask parity with the shipped reference, not a yaw replication).
Round-2 row: hull 38 whole 32.1 turret 67.6 stations 66.9 dims 100
floaters 100 (dims closed from 82.2: KwK 39 L/60 lengthened to published
overall 6.41; cupola stack lowered 0.03 to published heightM p95; muffler
tucked inside the hullLengthM span).

## ww2 r1 side-effect (2026-08-03)

32.1 -> 63.0 min WITHOUT a dedicated round (hull 38->74.1, whole 32.1->63,
turret 67.6->63.6*, stations 66.9->71.9, dims 100, floaters 100): the
shared pziiiHull re-author for pziii_konserwa (flat transmission deck,
driver plate, long rear-deck fall, tail undercut, segmented fenders,
symmetric flap anchors, high sprocket) generalized to this print.
*turret -4: the konserwa-shaped changes moved hull registration; the
newc turret hasn't had its own pass yet — its params (noseDeckY 1.42,
trackXc 1.20 preserved as-is) and its turret/schürzen are the next round.
Oracle stylization -4/-4.9% lengths, +2.2% height: NORMALIZATION PLAN
AUTHORED in tools/vertex-normalize.mjs (body x1.0404, muzzle 3.415->3.64,
y squeeze 2.554->2.50).

## ww2 r2 (2026-08-04)

63.0 -> 68.0 min (hull 74.1->73.6, whole 63->68.0, turret 63.6->74.3,
stations 71.9->75.7, dims 100, floaters 100; target 73 MISSED — honest
+5.0). Gate line x2 (68.0/68.0). Containment 0/0 exact (trackW 0.42->
0.40 at xc 1.20: band faces 1.00..1.40 = the ref's). Census mg1
(FITTINGS.pintleMG mag/dark beside the cupola, barrel forward).

Moved: the shared pziiiHull r2 rework (see pziii_konserwa r2: droop tips,
lower nose plate, floating tail band, flap anchor re-banding — newc keeps
its FAT front flap per its own ref's band-fat bow column, param
frontFlapFat) plus newc-only: TURRET +10.7 — external mantlet widened to
the ref's plan span (2.00 wide, centered -0.10 against the +0.12
fused-gun print cap), sleeve step extended to the ref's 1.74 plan front,
superstructure narrowed 1.41 -> 1.31 (the ref's front-view walls end
~1.31; 1.41 wrote +0.18 tops across x 1.32..1.46), KwK 39 muzzle to
published overall 6.41 (len 2.90). Rommelkiste kept at the r1 seat —
measured: a rear-shifted/enlarged bin and a raised rear-roof band BOTH
regressed (their reads were dAlong-blend artifacts, reverted).

Residuals: whole 68.0 = bow anchor columns vs tube-only ref bands +
registration wobble (dAlong danced -0.109..+0.034 across the round; the
best-state reconstruction landed -0.037-class); hull 73.6 vs r1 74.1 is
inside the same wobble. stations 75.7 (st tail columns follow the tail
rework). shots/ww2-r2/after/newc_pziii.png (eyeballed).
