# T-90A Burlak (`t90a_burlak`)

**Exact variant modeled:** experimental "Burlak" universal bustle-autoloader
turret (OKR Burlak, UKBTM 2000s) fitted to the T-90A hull — ROUNDED front
casting behind wrap-around armor modules, with the LONG squared rear bustle
(autoloader + ammo, ejection/feed hatches on its roof), commander station
with pano sight left-rear. The turret program was experimental; the §5.38
print is the authority on its unusual shape (owner order).

## Current runtime authority

The playable route uses `buildT90BurlakHybridNative2026`, which owns the
complete hull, six-wheel course, clipped turret foundation, shoulder armor,
autoloading bustle, and roof suite. The earlier `replaceT90BurlakTurret`
overlay lost its last caller with the retired full Burlak builder and was
removed as unreachable source in September 2026.

## Identity cues

- The LONG rectangular autoloader bustle (≈2 m deep, narrow ±0.84) riding
  from the casting rear out over the engine deck — the silhouette tell.
- Rounded plan front (staircase 1.6→1.05→0.77 halfW) behind big flat armor
  modules; the family '<' module pair meets at the gun (§5.29 nod).
- Commander station LEFT-REAR: cupola + pano mushroom + periscope domes;
  left roof rail-bin row; roof-front plate field (left emphasis).
- T-90A hull: K-5 glacis rows, full-length skirt ERA band, right-fender
  stowage row, engine-deck cover plate under the bustle sweep.

(raw ≈1:1 m; authored = +0.05 z; **hull/tread/suspension nodes are
byte-identical to the t90 print's** — one T-90 hull family):

## Certified caps (print-vs-datum, dims sovereign)

0. **Official receipt** (coordinator, 2026-08-08): orientation
   agree:true — CLEAN to score; heightPct +26.3 = the commander-cluster
   /module band vs the 2.30 datum (caps below). **AW sunk-turret
   interpen flag** (all three §5.38 prints, vladimir batch-50 class):
   sub-deck turret verts are print stylization (§B7 cap), never a
   build target.
0a. **WIDTH-NORMALIZATION CAP — RATIFIED §B7 (coordinator ruling,
   §5.50)**: the harness has no named-width mechanism and prints are
   not warped for it — the whole-print width (±2.04 cheek modules,
   Object_23) normalizes ×0.929 and shrinks the ref HULL to ~3.55 vs
   spec 3.78. STRUCTURAL CAP on hull rows, measured receipts: hull
   52.6 / front_hull 59.8 p95 10.16 (my tracks/skirts at ±1.6..1.81
   face the shrunken print's void; plan ±1.81 err 2.35). Ladders must
   not chase these columns inward — dims (3.78) is sovereign.
0b. **overallLengthM 9.76 — honest-variant spec (coordinator §5.50)**:
   the Burlak bustle overhangs the T-90A hull-rear datum (~9.76
   gun-forward total; print −3.66 corroborates). Proceeding at 9.76;
   ASK-OWNER banked by the orchestrator for spec-sovereignty
   ratification at landing.
0c. **PRESENTATION — CLEAN (§5.60, ff5b005; §5.50/§5.53 RETRACTED)**:
   the print was NEVER turret-reversed (accessor-bound receipts;
   refRootYaw=0 at HEAD). The r1/r2 "reversal" reads measured the
   orchestrator's live-uncommitted scene-yawOffset rows (§5.60 phantom
   chain; the harness's own rear-gun AUTO-FLIP compounded the §5.53
   probes). The delivered gate rows are the HONEST reads — ordinary
   shape deltas: next-round map = the turret-plan footprint spanning
   nearly the full tank (§5.60 receipt) + the ratified §B7 width cap
   (0a) + the dims-75 proc-vs-published residual (hullLengthM
   bustle-span datum, 0b).

1. **Module width** — print modules reach ±1.98/±2.04 while pub width is
   3.78 over skirts; whole-print width-normalization (÷4.07×3.78) shrinks
   the print's hull under my authored one. Authored module faces capped
   inside the 1.845/1.89 width court (widthAnchor law); the plan/front
   width columns beyond are a documented print-normalization cap.
2. **Commander cluster height** — print 2.69 vs the 2.30 datum (grace
   ≈2.323): authored ring/lid ≤2.31, Kord receiver ≈2.31 (pintle sunk),
   pano head the lone 2-col spike (2.44).
3. **Bustle tail** — print -3.66; authored solid to -3.48 + thin sliver
   step to -3.59 (turret rows may carry documented coverage cost; the
   hullLengthM body anchor is untouched — the bustle is turret mass).
4. **Print gun short** — muzzle 5.93 authored vs my 6.10 (dims sovereign;
   wholeCurves coverage cost documented, the standard short-tube class).

Board (IoU lane): 79.4 — hull 84.5, tracks 93.7, overall 85.2; the long-bustle identity reads unmistakably at every yaw (pre/post-§5.60 board scores identical — the board pipeline never carried the scene-yaw). |

Turret-plan residuals documented cap-class: the 9.76-protected tail columns, the Object_18-on-glacis print artifact (±0.7 front cols — turret kit over hull, never a build target), the dims-true casting vs ×0.929-shrunk ref (§B7 corollary; the ratified 3.05m casting census stands).
