# TANK BUILD STANDARD — the one checklist (owner-ratified laws, 2026-08-03)

For the current source-backed X workflow, start with the
[tank-generation handbook](tank-generation/README.md). It supplies intake,
construction, prompts, current tool coverage and handoff instructions. This
living rulebook retains August history: newer source-X contracts use the
**92-point exemplar floor**, source-only rigid/uniform registration, and explicit
source-versus-real-vehicle target decisions. Do not replay older nonuniform
oracle fitting, score-counterweight or mask-exclusion shortcuts for new source
studies. Missing historical tools are not available proof. See the handbook's
[chronology](tank-generation/README.md#authority-and-chronology) and
[quality gates](tank-generation/quality-gates.md) before applying an old recipe.

Every tank ships when it meets ALL of this. Builders self-check every round;
critics carry these as standing checks; the orchestrator lands nothing that
regresses them. This file supersedes scattered per-packet law restatements —
packets cite it. If this file and GEOMETRY-GATE.md disagree, GEOMETRY-GATE.md
wins and this file needs a patch.

LIVING RULEBOOK (owner directive 2026-08-04: "consistently be editing our
generating rules and procedures as were going through this"): this file is
edited CONTINUOUSLY, not at milestones. Every owner report becomes a law
here the same turn it arrives; every round's banked law discoveries that
generalize beyond one tank get folded in at landing (the per-packet law
bank stays the raw record). Builders and critics re-read this file at
round start — briefs cite section numbers, and a brief that predates a law
never excuses missing it.

## A. Geometry (the measured gate)
- `node tools/geometry-gate.mjs --ids=<id>` — every component ≥90
  (hullCurves, wholeCurves, turretCurves, stations, dims, floaters). Min is
  the headline. Dims sovereign to PUBLISHED dims (1% grace then −8/pct).
  Certified oracle-defect caps are the only exemption, never covering dims.
- Author from `tools/vertex-workorder.mjs` ABSOLUTE world columns (gate-JSON
  `at` values are camera-frame — never author from them).
- Registration counterweight: dims anchors symmetric about the ref's own
  12%-band mid, at the ref's own band heights.
- heightM p95 budget: ≤4 side columns above published height, aligned with
  the ref's own spikes.
- PROGRAM-FRAME CHIRALITY LAW (adjudicated 2026-08-07, two independent
  critics converged — ww2-resit + type74 verdicts): the program frame
  "+x = right" is CANON for authoring, even though glTF/three.js
  (+z forward, right-handed) makes physical vehicle-right = −x. Every
  ratified digest, side registration, and verdict crop is built on the
  program frame; a fleet x-flip would invalidate all of them for a
  sub-glance cosmetic. Consequences: (1) author handed kit per the
  program frame, uniformly; (2) a spec-true direct-drop print may read
  MIRRORED next to the proc in head-on pairs — bank a "mirrored in
  program frame" note in that oracle's packet (pt91m-class), it is NOT
  a build defect and costs no acid points; (3) critics judge handed
  kit for PRESENCE + CONNECTION, not side, unless the owner orders a
  specific side. Owner may override with a fleet x-flip order
  (schedule as its own wave; re-derive digests + re-crop verdicts).

## B. Silhouette identity (owner laws — all six are gate-blocking)
1. FRONT SLOPES: follow the reference's slopes — no flat fronts where the
   real vehicle rakes (M1 glacis is the canonical example). THIS INCLUDES
   TURRETS (owner directive 2026-08-04, with photo: "all abrams have
   sloped fronts of turrets"): the M1-family turret cheek faces rake back
   steeply — a vertical/slab turret front on any Abrams is a failing
   read. Critics: check the turret leading-edge angle in side/3-4 views
   against the reference photo class, not just the mask score.
   NO STAIRCASES (owner directive 2026-08-04, with screenshot: "prevent
   this little staircase effect in our tanks. we should have smoother
   slopes"): a slope is ONE raked surface — a slab, wedge, or loft —
   never a stack of boxes approximating it. Stepped quantization reading
   at 1× is a failing read even where the mask score tolerates it. Where
   the REAL vehicle carries plate courses (armor tiers, appliqué rows),
   author the actual course lines with co-planar or chamfered joints —
   not equal-height quantization steps. Mechanism: the smoothLoft /
   chord-limited-facet machinery (m47 r8 smoothBustle lineage) + slope
   caps co-planar onto the facet (FLAT-CAP-BEHIND-A-RAKE law). Critics:
   stair-step reads on any slope are an order, on every tank.
   SLOPE MOTIVATES THE MASS (owner directive 2026-08-05: "when we have a
   slope, keep in mind its not just a plate on stuff that makes a slope,
   it motivates the whole shaping"): a slope is never a plate laid over a
   boxy core — the raked surface drives the WHOLE volume's shaping. Side
   profiles follow the glacis rake, flanks and roofs meet raked faces on
   the slope's own lines, intersecting panels continue its geometry: real
   armor is a shaped mass, not a dressed box. Failing reads: a box corner
   or un-raked flank poking past a raked front; a rake that dead-ends
   into a vertical side wall the real vehicle blends; appliqué-slope over
   a rectangular silhouette. When authoring a slope, re-derive every
   surface it touches.
2. NO EMPTY AREAS / CONTIGUITY: no hollow pockets, no see-through voids, no
   gaps between masses, at ALL angles including top-down. Turrets are
   contiguous volumes; every standoff mass reads attached (mounts,
   brackets, contact shadows). Circular geometry reads circular in plan.
   NO TURRET HOLES: top-down and 55° tilt renders show filled decks — any
   sky/background reading through the hull or turret interior is a failure.
3. DECORATION MINIMUM: roof MACHINE GUNS are MANDATORY (multiple allowed
   and encouraged; add a tastefully-integrated pintle MG even where the ref
   lacks one — critics must not penalize that as parity deviation). Dress
   flat areas from: lights, ropes/tow cables, ladders, ERA/armor blocks,
   wooden trunks, canisters, bags, smoke launchers, railings/holders,
   crates, duffels, antennas. Use `KIT` fittings (kit.js) — don't hand-roll.
   NO MYSTERY BOXES (owner directive 2026-08-05: "there are just random
   boxes that are not ERAs around armor and especially guns and those
   need to be actual proper shapes or equipment instead of just
   rectangles" — named on the merkavas, t-xx series, m1a2 sepv2): every
   box-primitive must read as IDENTIFIABLE equipment at 1×. ERA carries
   its own grammar (tile pitch, wedge/brick profile, mounting rails);
   everything else must be a named thing with its tell — a sight has a
   hood + lens, a bin has a lid seam + latches, a launcher has tubes, a
   jerry can has its cross-stamping. Bare cuboids hovering near mantlets
   / gun roots / armor faces are a failing read: replace with the real
   equipment (KIT fittings first) or delete. Critics: unidentifiable
   rectangles are an order, everywhere, especially around guns.
4. TRACK CONTAINMENT: tracks never clip through any static hull solid — at
   the bow, stern, straight runs, or swept end transitions. Tracks are the
   one integrated smart-shoe layer (pad/grousers + recessed web,
   connectors, pins and guide horns in the same animated instance) riding
   real wheels; no clipping, no floating bands, separate connector mesh,
   or static silhouette fill may duplicate or occupy the animated course.
   `npm run tank:track:duplicates` is mandatory fleet protection. It is
   report-only and may classify only a proven redundant running-gear course;
   armor, hull plates, side/top skirts, mudguards, fenders, sponsons and
   track guards are protected bodywork and may never be removed or reshaped
   to satisfy a track audit.
   Mandatory check: `node tools/track-clip-audit.mjs --exact --strict
   --ids=<id>` — strict checks BOTH columns per zone plus the entire course
   sweep, reports `bandVox + shoeVox`, and requires every total to be zero.
   `shoeVox` is the
   PLAYER-VISIBLE bar (m1a1ha lesson, owner report 2026-08-05: shoes
   glitched through the rear plates while the band test read 0/0 — the
   band is NOT the visible surface). The visible track surface is the
   instanced shoe/pad envelope riding OUTSIDE the band: instance centers
   at rOut = trackTh/2 + 0.012 off the band centerline plus 0.073 m of
   pad+grouser depth (tankFactory buildRunningGear/trackShoeGeometries)
   = +0.085 m beyond the band outer face (~0.13 m off the centerline at
   the default trackTh 0.09). A plate can clear the band and still eat
   the shoes — bandVox=0 alone proves nothing about the visible read.
   Semantics: shoeVox counts hull-candidate surface voxels ≥1.5 cm
   INSIDE the world-transformed shoe instance solids at --exact
   (near-contact margin on the default run); hidden pads (coveredTop,
   thrown sides) don't count. In strict mode, only meshes explicitly owned
   as `userData.runningGear` are excluded; names, lane position,
   `trackGuard`, wrap dressing, and shadow/trim taxonomy cannot bypass the
   check. Real skirts and guards stay outside the swept solid. End caps,
   wrap pads, wheel faces, support rollers, suspension arms, idlers and
   final-drive sprockets must be authored as running gear. Any visible
   band/shoe count is a release blocker. Fleet comparison lives in
   `shots/track-clip-shoes.json` (blind spots ranked worst-first).
5. TURRET FURNITURE PARENTING (owner law 2026-08-04: "stuff in the back of
   the turrets … just stays there and isn't rotating with the turret").
   Everything that visually belongs to the turret — bustle racks, duffels,
   chain curtains, boxes on/against casting walls, casting antennas — MUST
   live under `rig_turret` so it yaws with it. Hull deck furniture the
   bustle merely overhangs stays in `rig_hull`. Both failure directions
   violate this law: STRANDED (turret furniture in hullG — static while
   the turret turns; the sepv3/merkava report) and DANGLING (hull
   furniture in turretG — sweeps mid-air on yaw; the m1a1 tow-cable
   incident). Fix by RE-PARENTING with world pose preserved at rest
   (turret-local = world − turretPivot), never by re-modelling: rest-pose
   masks, the gate, and rest renders must hold byte/pixel-identical.
   Check: `node tools/turret-parent-audit.mjs --ids=<id>` — stranded and
   dangling must be 0; `abutting` is a REVIEW tier (adjudicate on the
   render: attached-to-casting ⇒ re-parent; deck gear ⇒ leave). Note the
   audit is AABB-coarse: raised-deck hulls (kf51) false-flag deck plates
   as stranded, whole-bucket merged lofts flag on partial content, and
   below-deck ring tubs smear the casting envelope (the tool clamps the
   envelope floor to ringY−0.10) — adjudicate against source + renders,
   never blind-move. Instanced meshes are not audited; check them by eye
   at yaw. Two adjudicated classes: ORACLE-REGISTRATION-PINNED (the REF
   keeps the furniture hull-side — m1a2 works field, merkava3b/3c tail
   packs; fix is COUPLED: followers extension in the three maps + proc
   re-parent + full re-gate in one landing) and audit-artifact (document
   the negative). Graduates take the §10 graduate-change flow. RE-CERT
   BAR (merkava-b5 correction): rest-pixel-diff proof only certifies
   NON-camo-bucket moves — camo buckets bake bakeDirt mottle in the
   merged bucket's LOCAL frame, so any re-parent on a pivotZ≠0 rig
   reseeds the jitter and pixel-identity is unreachable; those take a
   full independent critic re-cert on the changed views instead.
   Floaters 100 ×2 + the yaw-90° rotating-furniture pair are required
   in every variant.
   PHYSICAL-SEAT GATE (owner Challenger 3/AbramsX correction,
   2026-08-10): coherent yaw proves PARENTING ONLY. It does not prove
   that a sight, ERA cassette, weapon station, service box or bracket is
   physically attached. Every turret-owned solid needs a continuous
   overlapping load path into the actual local roof/cheek/bustle surface;
   authored open mechanisms may contain real internal daylight, but no
   complete component may be carried by empty air. Never seat forward or
   aft equipment from a global peak-roof constant when the local crown is
   sloped or stepped. The receipt must include low left/right garage-side
   views at yaw 0 and 90 plus close-roof/top views. It must also identify
   the model source used by the playable garage path: an oracle-only GLB
   cannot silently replace a repaired procedural build. Challenger 3's
   peak-datum fittings and the recovered AbramsX's stilted RWS are the
   canonical false-pass cases.
6. TRACK RUN SILHOUETTE (owner law 2026-08-04: "tracks are the shape
   \\________/ not /_____/"). Side view: the ground run is the SHORT base
   of a trapezoid — approach/departure ramps rise to RAISED end wheels at
   BOTH ends. Never a parallelogram, never a flat/curl-to-ground front.
   Author both end wheels raised per the real vehicle (idler AND
   sprocket); `buildRunningGear`'s contact tangents then form the ramps
   (contactZF/contactZR pin the patch when needed). A low-authored end
   wheel (chieftain5's idler at wheel height) violates the law EVEN WHEN
   the oracle print carries the same defect — owner law outranks oracle
   matching (M1-slope precedent): build the real ramp, measure the
   oracle delta, certify the residual in the packet.

## C. Craft laws (mask economy + render truth)
- PALE-REFUND by default on every new thin member; paired refunds at razor
  margins; pintle-gun silhouette allowance ≤0.4 gate pts/tank.
- MG PHYSICS: sky-backed guns read pale top-lit (≥2px edges, 35-45px runs,
  receiver MASS not a stick, sky silhouette); pale-deck roof guns invert —
  dark crown-riding lines.
- Winding audit on every new slab (backface culling eats reversed slabs
  from top); probe corners after compound rotations; AABB framing on
  fittings (never change the model AABB with decoration).
- TWISTED-QUAD TOOTH ROW (merkava4 r-round): a strip-fan cheek under a
  large cheekRake renders a phantom tooth row when the plan pts polyline
  CURVES — each slab quad goes non-planar, its two triangles take
  different normals, and the lit/shaded alternation reads as sawteeth
  riding the wedge. At cheekRake > ~0.2 either keep the pts polyline
  straight (per-strip near-planarity, |(C−A)·n| ≲ 0.02r) or solve a top
  height for exact coplanarity; audit every slab() whose four corners are
  authored independently.
- PARTIAL-PIXEL MARGIN (russia-tail law, supersedes the bare 15mm at
  boundaries): masks light at ANY partial pixel coverage — boundary-
  critical faces need >=2px margins (~22mm side/plan, ~9mm front).
- dALONG-SIGN: at dAlong +d the gate compares ref column Z against the
  proc window [Z, Z+2d] — rear content seats half a column REARWARD of
  raw ref reads; check the sign before authoring from seats.
- Tone work hits the ORDERED class (floor-cliff regimes) — overshoot
  inverts the law. Material splits are free where geometry is priced
  (rear-visible content below the idler-wrap line writes side-mask
  bottoms — split materials instead).
- Shadow proxies: A/B mask dumps (russia r29) show proxies EXCLUDED from
  gate masks in the current harness — but their SIZES must still track
  the real geometry (a stale spec value ran a gun proxy 1.3m long).
  Verify per-harness before pricing either way; the older 'proxies ARE
  in masks' reading is stale for the gate path.
- SHADOW-NAMED RENDER FURNITURE (leopard §B5-r16): /shadow/i-named meshes
  render in critic/game views but are excluded from EVERY measurement
  mask (fidelity baseVisible, evaluator proxy-hide, critic framing) — the
  legal mechanism for honest voids/shadow reads the masks must not price
  (e.g. a turret-ring gap). Parent them to the mass that casts them (the
  turret, not the hull) and the §B5 parent audit stays clean.
- STATION END-CAPS (uk r3): station slices render front-on with near/far
  clipping — thin axis-aligned planes paint only their end caps and VANISH
  from mid slices. Segment long thin members (fenders, guards, skirt lips)
  into ≤0.48 m chunks. Related: decals ARE mask geometry (pin them on real
  planes); keep boundary-critical faces ≥15 mm clear of trace-column
  boundaries (AA bleed lights the neighbor column); one stray body-thick
  column at a silhouette edge shifts dAlong half a pitch and smears every
  row in that view.

## D. Measurement discipline (claims law)
- Done-gates measure on the OFFICIAL rigs only: gate runs +
  `tools/tmp-tank-critic.mjs --id=<id>` pairs. Bespoke harnesses are
  diagnosis-only. Custom crops never count as verdict evidence.
- ANGLES / EXACT GEOMETRY / ROUNDNESS (owner directive 2026-08-03):
  `node tools/visual-evaluator.mjs --id=<id>` is part of the official rig
  set — critics run it EVERY visual round (same 14 critic views, camoSeed
  4242, <10 s). Any claim about edge angles/slopes (glacis-rake class),
  rounded structures (radii, arc spans, domes reading polygonal — lathe
  facet counts), or silhouette profile deltas CITES ITS NUMBERS: segment
  Δangle with its printed ± noise band, arc radius/span/fit-residual and
  facet read, per-column top/bottom deltas in world meters. Eyeball reads
  of these classes no longer count as evidence. Round evidence lives at
  shots/visual-eval-<id>/ (report.json + annotated overlay per view).
  - RIG PARITY IS GATING: a `RIG MISMATCH` verdict (yaw-proxy > 10° —
    skew flip or principal-axis break; driver exits 2) ABORTS scoring.
    Fix registration first, never score a mismatched pair (the pt91m
    yaw-180 class would have been caught before round 1).
  - Calibration (re-derive with `--selftest`): angle σ ≈ 24/len_px°
    (~0.1° on ≥1 m edges); sub-0.25 m segments carry corner bias (±4°
    floor) — a Δ below the printed noise band is NO-FINDING. Radii honest
    to ~3%; facet count ±1; `reads polygonal` requires both >1.2° tangent
    steps AND overlay-visible sagitta.
  - Coordinates in findings are PROC-frame world (comparison itself is
    self-registered per-model rig; the printed ref↔proc world offset is
    registration data, not a defect).
- Sky/air claims: MASK-METHOD (bg |px−0x151b20| maxch ≤13 + rect) PLUS
  the BLUE-SIGNATURE term (revolution-r7 critic find): a sky pixel must
  also read B−R ≥ +8 — warm near-black track-shadow (e.g. 24,22,19)
  passes the maxch window alone and inflates hole counts 5-15×. Tone
  claims: ITU-601 luma rects WITH coordinates. Banked numbers re-derive
  from current renders before re-use.
- REF-RENDER OUTRANKS ROW ANALYSIS; ref-silhouette permit; perspective-
  volume verified in hero views.
- PROBE-FRAME LAW (ariete render-scale find, 6bf35b8): the fidelity
  harness scales BOTH roots so visible-box width = spec widthM — every
  external probe/raycast must apply that factor (or decode via a
  gate-identical in-page instrument) or it reads authored coords ~1%
  off the mask and "finds" phantom columns (the ariete ±1.72 class =
  its own skirt at scaled x; the bradley procTop divergence = the same
  family). The widest authored |x| sets the factor — grid boundaries
  are shared-box-relative.
- HERO-VOID BORDER-CLIP (r12 law, now in the tool): the evaluator
  reports open border-cut chains under `borderClips`, never as holes —
  critics stop ordering geometry at them.

## E. Oracle repairs (orchestrator lane ONLY — warp law v2)
- Fresh `.bak` from committed HEAD bytes per batch (equal-tris/fewer-verts
  census mismatch = STALE-BAK signature — refresh, never patch expects
  down). Legacy recipes demote to history when the baseline advances.
- Never flat-assign `REPAIRS[id]` over an existing entry.
- Every batch verifies IN THE GATE against a stable proc build before
  commit; documented retune debts are the only acceptable regressions.
- Builders/critics REPORT normalize plans + literals; they never run
  repairs or touch GLBs.
- VLO-BAKE POLLUTION (leo2_revolution §B5-r16): recovered prints'
  `*_vlo` whole-vehicle LOD shells ride the HULL node and bake at-rest
  articulated content into every hull/whole mask (128 polluted side
  columns measured on revolution — the proc then mirrors the bake and
  the turret "fuses"). Audit any print carrying `_vlo`-suffixed nodes
  before trusting its hull rows (t64bv1 / t72* / t90* class candidates).
  When a proc build mirrored the bake, the LOD-delete repair is a COUPLED
  graduate-change: repair alone gates 0 — both halves land in ONE commit.
- REQUEST-INTERCEPTION SIM: verify candidate oracle repairs against the
  UNMODIFIED official gate math via puppeteer request interception
  (`req.respond()` serving candidate GLB bytes at the reference URL) —
  full-fidelity coupled-state verification with zero shared-file edits.
  Prove rig parity to the decimal (committed bytes × HEAD tree) before
  trusting any simulated number.

## F. Round protocol (uniform for every family agent)
1. One agent per profile file (single-owner). NEVER commit. Env:
   `export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"`; own vite
   74xx-77xx; FIFO lock respected.
   FIFO HARD RULES (fleet-proven 2026-08-05): the official browser tools
   (track-clip, turret-parent, standard-check, visual-evaluator,
   tank-critic) SELF-TICKET the FIFO — NEVER wrap them in an external
   lock hold (wrapping deadlocks the fleet; two independent jams proven).
   Tickets are 15-digit zero-padded — any other width corrupts the FIFO
   sort and queue-jumps. Under heavy contention official runs can die at
   the tools' 30-min queue timeout: retry honestly, never jump; for
   render batches hold ONE ticket with a batch driver on the identical
   render path (tmp-b1b3-critic-batch.mjs pattern).
2. Graduates in your file are HASH-FROZEN: verify with
   `node tools/tmp-hashgeo.mjs --ids=<graduates>` before reporting;
   shared-helper edits are opt-in params with byte-identical defaults.
   Do-not-gate list: m60a1, m60a3, kv2.
3. Every round ends with: gate line ×2, regenerate that tank's nine asset
   outputs from the clean landing candidate
   (`npm run tank:assets -- --ids=<id>`), then the unified release check
   (`npm run tank:release:check -- --ids=<id>`). The release check requires
   current hashed hero/top/side views, both silhouettes, armor/module/crew
   diagrams, markings, one valid I-X tier, penetration + module metadata, and a visible
   machine-tagged muzzle bore. It also renders and ray-tests that bore
   straight-on, then runs the existing standard-check, `npm test`, and the
   private production build. Packet round section is
   WRITTEN (landing law — orchestrator writes a landing note if missing,
   and that costs the round a discipline flag), shots under shots/<round>/.
4. Report format: per-tank before/after components, per-order done-gates
   with official-rig measurements, honest residuals, worst remaining
   columns, graduate hash proof, law discoveries for the bank.

## G. Definition of DONE (unchanged, dual gate)
Geometry ≥90 every component + independent critic ≥9.0 EVERY view (same
vehicle, same tier) + turntable eyeball + graduation per GEOMETRY-GATE.md
§10 in the same commit. Any geometry edit invalidates a prior critic
verdict.

## H. RIG STANDARD (owner directive 2026-08-03: standard + family rigs)
Tanks are built as RIGS, not bespoke mesh piles. Three layers:

1. **BASE RIG** (KIT layer, kit.js): every tank exposes the same skeleton —
   hull loft (station-profile driven), running gear (wheelZs/wheelR/idler/
   sprocket + the two-layer track system), turret ring + yaw pivot, gun
   assembly (trunnion/mantlet/tube/muzzle) with elevation pivot, fittings
   mounts (KIT.fittings consumers), family material slots. The gate's
   articulation poses and the game's damage/recoil systems assume this
   skeleton — a build that fights it is wrong even at 90+.

2. **FAMILY RIG** (one per family file): similar tanks SHARE one
   parameterized rig — abrams varieties (m1a1/m1a1ha/m1a2/tejas/tusk/
   abramsx/sepv2), leopard varieties (leo2a4/a5/a6/a7/a7v/revolution/
   proto), merkavas (1b/2b/2d/3b/3c/3d/4/4b), t-series lineages
   (t54/t62/t64/t72/t80/t84/t90 chains), pattons (m26/m45/m46/m47/m48/
   m60s), centurions, IS-line. A variant is a PARAM DELTA on its family
   rig (dims, turret planform, skirt/ERA kit, fittings selection, era
   dressing) — not a new loft. Litmus: adding the next variant of a family
   should be <150 lines of params, not a re-author. The t80/t80b/t80bv
   batch (russia r25) and merkava_batch4() are the live exemplars.

3. **MIGRATION RULE**: graduates are hash-frozen — they adopt the family
   rig ONLY inside a graduate-change round (fix → gate hold → critic
   re-cert → re-freeze, one commit), never as a side effect. New builds
   and rebuilds go through the family rig from birth; a family's first
   rig-conformant build defines the rig (document its param surface in the
   family packet). Orchestrator schedules rig-consolidation rounds per
   family once ≥2 variants pass the gate.

4. **VARIANT VARIETY (owner directive 2026-08-03)**: sharing a rig must
   NOT mean looking alike. Every variant in a family carries a DISTINCT,
   era/mark-appropriate loadout — different MG arrangements, stowage
   selections, ERA/appliqué kits, antennas, lights, dressing — such that a
   player can tell any two family members apart in the garage at a glance.
   Reference truth first (each mark's real distinguishing kit), then
   FITTINGS variety within the decoration law. Critics carry a standing
   VARIANT-DISTINCTIVENESS check whenever a family has ≥2 built members:
   name the tells; 'same tank re-badged' is a failing read. The t80 line
   (B brow applique, BV K-1 cheeks) and the abrams variety round are the
   exemplars.

## I. KIT.fittings usage (§B3/§B4 workflow — kit-fittings round)
Decoration is a WORKFLOW, not per-tank authorship: use
`KIT.fittings.<fn>` (src/vehicles/profiles/kit.ts) — hand-authored
decorations need a packet justification.
- Library: `pintleMG` (M2/DShK/NSVT/MAG classes, tone
  'two-tone'/'pale'/'dark' per MG PHYSICS deck polarity, optional AA ring /
  ammo / shield), `stowageRack`, `towCable`, `jerryCans`,
  `spareTrackLinks`, `lightCluster`, `smokeBank`, `antennaWhip`,
  `unditchingLog`. All deterministic (seed param, no Math.random), material
  slots come from the caller's own family mats.
- Call pattern (in a profile builder):
  `import { KIT, FITTINGS } from './kit.ts';`
  `const mg = FITTINGS.pintleMG({ mats: P.mats, cls: 'm2' });`
  `mg.position.set(x, roofY, z); P.turretG.add(mg);`
  (`KIT.fittings` is the same object on every runtime path; the `FITTINGS`
  import is the spelling that also survives synchronous top-level
  createTank rigs — kit.js evaluates inside the tankFactory module cycle,
  see the attach-site note in kit.js.)
  Anchor the WHOLE stamped envelope (`group.userData.aabb`) INSIDE the
  hull/turret AABB — fittings must never change the model AABB (§C).
- Census (§B3 machine check): every fitting mesh carries
  `userData.fitting`; `node tools/tank-standard-check.mjs --ids=<id>`
  requires mg ≥ 1 fitting instance and reports the dressing count, plus the
  §B2 top-down hole scan (0 enclosed cells). Hand-authored decoration
  censuses ZERO — migrate it or justify it in the packet.
- Library self-test: `node tools/tank-standard-check.mjs --fixture`
  (marker coverage, AABB stamp, seed determinism, top-down winding).

## J. Critic-lane laws (banked 2026-08-05, abrams+revolution re-cert wave)
- YAW-PAIR EVIDENCE IS HASH-STAMPED: a builder's rest/yaw90 proof pair is
  only valid at the hash it rendered; graduation/re-cert critics re-render
  the yaw pair at the verdict hash.
- PAIR-PNG LABEL BAND: flood/sky tooling on critic pair PNGs must exclude
  the REFERENCE/PROCEDURAL label band (y 13-21) — letter counters read as
  enclosed sky under the mask+blue-signature method.
- DE-BAKE CONTRAST WINDOW (§E corollary): dropping a vlo bake opens honest
  dark windows — previously-certified adjacent furniture inherits a new
  high-contrast read; any vlo-drop round re-audits furniture bordering new
  shadow windows even where its bytes did not change.
- YAW-PROOF STATIC-PIXEL FALSE-FLAG: rest-vs-yaw90 pixel diffs flag
  same-camo turret faces as "static" inside the ring zone; adjudicate
  against a rig_hull/rig_turret vertex census (instanced meshes included)
  before ordering geometry.

## §D addenda (russia tail-3, 2026-08-05)
- PROBE-FRAME AUTHORING LAW: the §D width-normalization factor bakes into
  AUTHORING — any build whose widest authored |x| exceeds the width anchor
  scales every coordinate (~1% inboard/short seats, dead ground columns,
  short hullLengthM). Keep the width-defining face AT the anchor: scale
  1.0, authored = world.
- AA-TEETER FAMILY: ref bands whose edges sit on column-window boundaries
  flip reads run-to-run as the shared box drifts; only >=2px-from-edge
  authoring is stable — single-run reads of such columns are NOT orders.
- STATION RE-PHASE COROLLARY: hullZRange span changes re-phase all 14
  slices; post-span-fix station drops are re-decode artifacts first.
- DIMS RAZOR-BAND: a body column hovering at the 12% threshold coin-flips
  dims ±8 pts — pin end columns with hard cross-section faces.
- BG-TOLERANCE DARK-TRACK BLINDNESS (§J addendum, m1a2 re-cert): mask
  diffs with bg tolerance maxch<=13 cannot see the 0x171614 track tone —
  pale dressing added there reads as false "silhouette growth"; decompose
  render diffs against changed stations before pricing.
- Record the pixel-diff threshold alongside banked px counts (t>4 vs t>2
  reads ~30% apart on identical bboxes).

## §C addendum — INVISIBLE-LOD ENVELOPE law (owner task, 2026-08-05)
Invisible meshes still carry world AABBs (Box3.setFromObject, icon
framing, probes, hashers all include them). State-gated visuals
(destruction kits, retracted gear) are built LAZILY at the state
transition — never parked hidden at their triggered pose; the rest scene
graph carries no geometry outside the visible hull envelope
(tools/tmp-lod-envelope-probe measures it). Corollaries: "invisible at
LOD0" is not proof of LOD1 geometry (lodWrap LOD1 levels are empty by
design); keep MATERIAL creation eager when deferring construction
(material ids are a draw-sort key — deferred clones renumber and break
pixel identity).
- DEEP-SHADE ALBEDO CLAMP (§J addendum, revolution r17): zero-variance
  dark zones (p10=p50=p90) are shadow reads — tint work provably cannot
  move them; critics check percentile spread before ordering mottle.
- BURIED-FURNITURE PROBE FALSE-ATTRIBUTION: world-box probes name
  occluded geometry; decode screen rects with the critic's own projection
  and verify tells by pixel-diff before dressing.
- BAKE-MIRROR NARROW-NOT-DROP: when one row read of a bake-mirror is
  real, narrow it to its witness column instead of deleting.
- LIVE-TREE FROZEN-SIB HAZARD (§F addendum): foreign shared-module WIP
  moves every family hash — clean-room worktrees are the honest frame for
  freeze proofs; handover sweeps can commit mid-round builder snapshots.
- PER-ROW BODY-FILTER / REGISTRATION-COUNTERWEIGHT LAW (§D addendum, m26
  r3): the 12% body filter uses each row's OWN rough — a dims tail anchor
  fat for side_whole is automatically fat for side_hull and shifts the
  hull-row registration mid; hull reg pins whole+turret (0.05 dAlong cost
  6 turret pts). Counterweight the HULL-row body symmetrically so proc
  mids == ref mids on every row.
- Station-boundary bumps >=10mm clear of slice boundaries (9mm slivers
  read full width). Shoe pads extend wrap faces +0.05-0.08 beyond
  r+CLEAR+TH/2 — seat end wheels by vertex probe.

## §B7. OWNER REF-WRONG OVERRIDE (owner ruling 2026-08-05, leo2_revolution turret)
When the owner rules a reference region WRONG ("the revolution turret
looks terrible because its source material is wrong — make it more like
the actual tank"), the REAL VEHICLE (photo class) governs that region,
not the print. Mechanics: (1) author the region to the real vehicle's
documented configuration; (2) the gate keeps recording honest rows — the
divergence is certified in the packet as an OWNER REF-WRONG cap (region,
rows, measured cost, owner quote + date); caps never cover dims; (3)
critics score the overridden region against the real-vehicle photo class,
ref parity applies everywhere else; (4) the override is per-region, not
per-tank — uncontested regions still chase the print; (5) prefer
mask-free real-vehicle reads first — spend gate points only where the
real configuration demands it.
- TURRET-FLIP CENSUS FRAME (§E addendum, batch-43): a print's TurretMesh
  content can render PI-YAWED about the turret pivot vs raw glb coords
  (loader rest-yaw) while the Gun subtree does not — glb-frame censuses
  map to gate meaning with x AND z negated for the turret node only.
  Attribute by station ownership before excising (the "fore strip" that
  owned st12 was the rotating bustle tail plate).
- DEGENERATE-SLIVER MASK CARRIERS: one zero-area triangle can carry
  double-digit gate points (a 3v/1t sliver held 34.6 turret pts on
  revolution). Component censuses must list 1-tri components, and
  oracle-excision rounds check them FIRST — they are free wins with
  differential-sim proof.

## §B3.1 GUN-ASSEMBLY ACCURACY (owner directive 2026-08-06: "sepv2 and
sepv3 and the merkavas have those really ugly gun rectangular prisms and
dont look accurate" + "many of the russian tanks have those weird
rectangular prisms that dont emulate actual armor or equipment")
The GUN ASSEMBLY itself is never a prism. Tube = cylinder; thermal
sleeve = larger cylinder with clamp rings; bore evacuator = the real
weapon's bulged sleeve at its real station; muzzle = the real brake/
reference collar; mantlet = the real casting/shroud shape (M256 boxy
shroud has RAKED faces, MG253 sits in a recessed collar, Russian 125mm
carries its distinctive mantlet boot). A rectangular prism anywhere on
the gun run is a failing read at 1x. This extends §B3 (equipment
grammar) to the weapon: author from the real gun's photo class, not
from mask convenience. Critics: prism reads on any gun run are an
order, on every tank, priority equal to a silhouette break.

## §B1.1 CHEEK SYMMETRY (owner directive 2026-08-06: "left cheek of all
abrams have weird rectangles instead of the correct slopes")
Both turret cheeks carry the real vehicle's rake — asymmetric detail
(sights, MG mounts) rides ON the raked plane; it never replaces the
plane with stacked rectangles. Failing read: a correct right cheek and
a boxy left cheek (or vice versa). Critics check BOTH cheeks in both
front-quarter views on every tank.

## §C addendum — MISSING-SIDE CLASS (owner report 2026-08-06: "ariete
and leclerc are missing left side of turrets")
Side masks image ONE side: a missing/reversed LEFT surface is invisible
to every side row and can survive to high gate scores. Mandatory checks
on every round: the §C winding audit + a LEFT-side render (or yaw-180
pair) compared against the right. A missing side is a §B2 void — gate
score is no defense.
- MISSING-SIDE MECHANISM DECODED (§C, misc left-side round 2026-08-06):
  mirror loops (`for s of [-1,1]` with x*s and no corner re-order) hand
  slab builders the OPPOSITE ring handedness — all six faces point
  inward, the solid is backface-culled in every FrontSide render (game,
  critic, standard-check) yet stays FULLY VISIBLE to the gate's
  DoubleSide mask material. The gate structurally cannot see this class.
  Device: an orientedSlab wrapper (face-outwardness census, re-orients
  reversed rings) — bind slab through it in every profile that mirrors.
  Known carriers still open: t80u (1), type90 (4+1), type74 (1+1).
- LOADER HEIGHT-CLAMP KEYING (§E, fv510 batch-44): modelLoader scales by
  min(len, width*1.08, height*1.30) — mast-heavy prints bind on HEIGHT
  and a pure z-warp is normalized away until a y-knee releases the
  clamp. Verify which min() term binds before authoring any warp; judge
  warps by ROW terms (mean/p95/cover/safeScale), never the 0-floored
  headline (curve score = 100 - 12*mean - 0.6*p95 - 1.5*cover: the 12x
  mean term floors short/shape-divergent prints at 0 regardless).
- Mirrored-slab winding guards are now per-profile devices: orientedSlab
  (misc.ts) / sslab (uk.ts) — every profile that mirrors slabs binds
  through one (§C missing-side law).
- INSCRIBED-DRUM CONVERSION CLASS (§B3.1, russia sweep): box->cylinder
  (r = w/2, axis-extreme) and box->elliptical-frustum swaps keep side AND
  plan mask rectangles identical — the free §B3.1 conversion; reach for
  it first on every prism. Corollaries: RING-CLIP (boot collars under
  cover slabs clip to the tube's front silhouette or corners poke);
  proud face-relief on certified rows is never free (flush or pay).
- ROUNDED-RECT CARRIER COMPOSITION (§B3.1, merkava gun round): de-prism a
  mask-certified box with flat cardinal carrier slabs on the certified
  extents + corner cylinders (AA-identical silhouette edges; corner
  rounds inset by the box bevel radius). Corollaries: the 45° SHOULDER
  ZONE of any convex round member is interior to both masks — dressing
  there is free; FLOATER-BY-BRIDGE (standoffs can idle under the island
  threshold bridged only by a neighbor's corner — audit helper-placed
  fittings per mark); island hunts run at GATE resolution (384px masks
  dilation-bridge gaps the 1024 gate keeps open).
- CYLINDER-AT-PRISM-ENVELOPE (§B3.1, abrams round): an elliptical
  z-cylinder at the box's half-extents produces byte-identical side/plan
  columns — the free swap wherever the front view is interior. GATE-GRID
  SPAN LAW: the gate's 96 columns end short of extreme tail content —
  verify grid membership before spending on workorder-only columns.
  SCORE SATURATION: err-9 only-proc columns dominate a row; when an
  uncertified only-proc class saturates, the CERT is the ceiling driver
  — file the cert extension, don't chase columns.
- CHANGED-VIEW LISTS ARE DIFF-DERIVED (§J, merkava gun re-cert): builders'
  occlusion reasoning under-lists — derive the critic's scoring contract
  from actual per-view pixel diffs. §B2 FLOOD-DELTA METHOD: fresh-vs-
  baseline enclosed-px per view separates new holes from banked censuses
  (delta-0 under a localized change = the clean re-cert signature).
  ROUNDED-RECT SEG floor: facet sagitta < 1 px at the largest critic zoom
  is the machine check for "no polygonal read".
- TONE-ROUND CRITIC TRIPLET (§J, revolution r19): self-colored-unit
  homogenization reads as p90 down + sd down with med free — read the
  triplet, not the med. Re-cert diffs spanning an oracle-repair landing
  decompose per pair-half before attribution. Flood delta-0 doubles as
  the whole-frame no-regression oracle for tone-only rounds.
- ENVELOPE-SWAP SIDE-READ (§B3.1 corollary, abrams re-cert): cylinder-at-
  prism-envelope conversions are silhouette-invisible in the preserved
  projections — critics judge them by shading gradient + ring grammar,
  not silhouette. CHIN-STEP ADJUDICATION (§B1.1 corollary): certified
  column bottoms pinning a stepped chin under a raked cheek always flag a
  horizontal-vs-chamfer delta — adjudicate against the packet constraint
  first; one constraint ledge is not the colonnade class.

## §B3.2 DECORATION DENSITY (owner directives 2026-08-06, with screenshots)
"add far more of these decorations on ALL abrams" + russia: "the most
common decorations still need to be modelled and added, and many more
machine guns of all varieties or automated machine gun emplacements".
§B3's minimum is now a DENSITY mandate: real vehicles are BUSY — every
tank carries its type's full common kit (lights + guards, mirrors, tow
cables + shackles, jerry cans, stowage bins/baskets LOADED, antennas,
straps, spare track links, tools) and crew-served weapons at real
density: MGs of all varieties (pintle, coax port, loader's, bow where
real) AND automated emplacements (CROWS/RWS with sensor heads) where the
mark carries them. Variant kits are REAL SYSTEMS: TUSK = ARAT ERA tiles
+ loader shield + TIP + slat + urban lights; SEP kits ride the family
base build (owner: sepv2/sepv3/tusk are "based off of our existing m1a1
abrams with the extra armoring and ERA and urban survival kit").
- STATIC-VS-MOVING-CHAIN (§B4, leopard shoe round): the wrap "inner
  void" is fiction — the shoe's integrated connector/pin/guide geometry
  (radial ~0.13-0.40 off wheel centers) SWEEPS it as tracks scroll; static
  furniture inside a wrap clears the component
  deep-windows, not the band. Drum-face rim rings sized to the drum are
  the standing carrier class. PROJECTION-PRESERVING SPLIT: an inboard
  x-sliver (side mask x-invariant) + a thin outer-z plate (plan/front
  faces exact) clears 3D shoe overlap with zero mask movement.
  Thin-component exemption: boxes with any dimension < 2x the depth bar
  cannot carry it — deep-window math skips them.
- COMPONENT-MASK FREE-LANE LAW (§C, russia density round): the
  "turret-shadow deck lane" does not exist in the hull-only mask — a
  proud deck rack costs hull AND shears registration. Hull-mask free
  lanes are: flush-recess to the deck polyline, nesting inside certified
  bump envelopes, or sub-line side cover. MATCHED-ENVELOPE MG SWAP:
  FITTINGS.pintleMG reproduces hand receivers within 4mm — droop longer
  barrels under local crests. COAX-PORT CLASS: flush ports inside
  scaled-ellipse mantlet rectangles are invisible to every mask.
- §B4 STERN-RESUME (abrams density round): a laneCarve window ending
  short of the tail-rake end deletes the outboard tail — hull builders
  resume full width behind the window. Corridor-annulus: LC.x closes to
  <=3.5cm of the band inner face or the gap reads as top-down sky.
  WF-SPLIT REGISTRATION ASYMMETRY: identical deck dressing can be free
  on one variant and cost another (works-mask absorption vs bare-deck
  registration) — bisect per variant. FLOOD IS BLIND TO WINDING:
  reversed slabs read as open background, never enclosed holes — renders
  are the witness. §H.4 corollary (owner check 2026-08-06): weapon kit
  is NATIONAL grammar — US marks read American (M2HB jacket collar +
  spade grips + hung can, M240 gas tube, CROWS sensor cluster), Soviet
  marks read NSVT/Kord; critics flag cross-national silhouettes.
- WIDTH-GUARD-BY-DRESSING (§D, leclerc front round): ONE proud fitting
  past the width anchor rescales the whole build (a 4cm guard post cost
  dims 100->53.6) — every fitting respects the anchor. RNG-STREAM
  STABILITY: inserting stowage() entries re-jitters every later priced
  bag — append at stream end or hand-stamp. EULER-COMPOSED FITTINGS:
  rx/ry-only helpers cannot reach vertical faces — check the composed
  frame. AA-SLIVER OWNERSHIP: a millimeter face kiss can own a column —
  re-own such lines with honest geometry, not deletion.

## §E addendum — ORACLE PROVENANCE (2026-08-06, base-21 wave)
Embedded `asset.extras` license/author is a STARTING point, never proof.
Before an oracle instruments a gate, check the LIVE source page:
description text (e.g. "from War Thunder"), tags (warthunder,
world-of-tanks, createdwithai), and the uploader's history. Three of one
eight-file wave failed: one confirmed game rip (deleted from the repo —
THE ONE ABSOLUTE RULE), one from an adjudicated rip-posting account
(quarantined to the gitignored candidates area pending owner
adjudication — held, not destroyed, absent per-asset evidence), one
AI-generated (kept but never registered: measurement-unusable). A
refused oracle NEVER writes a ledger row — a registration that cannot
load times out at 150 s and taxes every later fleet run, and the row it
would leave is a FALSE-0.

## §B2 CLARIFICATION — HOLES, NOT CHANNELS (owner ruling 2026-08-06, with
## screenshot; reverts gear r8/r8b)
Owner verbatim: "all tanks have this terrible gray rectangle under the
tanks - this is completely wrong ... when i talked abotu space under
slopes, i met having hulls not have holes, not just willy nilly filling
in space." The §B2 no-empty-areas law means the HULL VOLUME is closed —
you never see through a hull or into an unmodeled interior. It does NOT
mean the open air between the track runs gets filled: the ground
channel, wheel-train daylight, and under-sponson air are REAL on the
real vehicles. A factory-wide belly slab is the wrong mechanism twice
over — it curtains the running gear from the side (owner's gray
rectangle) and it breaks the §D width anchor on narrow-track builds.
The right mechanism is PER-TANK authored hull geometry: real belly
plates at the real height, sponson undersides, closure panels INBOARD
of the band inner faces (the ww2-lane channel-pan class, ±3cm clear) —
authored where the real tank has metal, never where it has air.

NO-AIR PRINCIPLE (owner law 2026-08-07, after the merkava under-roof
closures): "have a principle of no air between stuff except for stuff
like tracks holding up the hull and the turret intersecting into a
hull where there is bound to be air." Structural pieces CONNECT — no
air gaps between a plate and what it mounts on, no hovering side
plates, no roof floating over an unbuilt volume, no glacis with a
void beneath it. The ONLY legitimate air classes: (1) track/suspension
air (the running gear holding up the hull — wheel-train daylight is
real), (2) turret-ring intersection air (the turret bearing into the
hull), (3) authored open structure that is real configuration (basket
frames, slat armor, ball-and-chain — the merkava-certified classes).
Everything else closes with the piece's own geometry per the
holes-not-channels ruling above. Critics: hovering plates and
under-glacis voids are orders on every tank.
- FITTINGS-IMPORT-ONLY (§B3 mechanics, slice-3): extension-module
  builders use the top-level `import { FITTINGS }` — there is no
  kitFittings(); KIT.fittings attaches post-init via microtask; and an
  extension module as import ENTRY throws kit.js's TDZ spuriously —
  smoke-load via tankFactory.ts. SWEPT-PLANAR CORE (§B1): behind
  plan-swept raked cheeks an axis-aligned core pokes the rake or opens a
  top-down valley — author L/R half-slabs with vertical front faces on
  the cheek top-rear edge line. CHEEK-APEX GLACIS SEAT: apex overhang
  floats over the raked plane — sink bottom rings interior (-0.08
  class). ERA-DEF/GEOMETRY COUPLING (§D): re-anchoring ERA-carrying
  geometry moves the era-kind armor defs in the SAME edit. Hash
  invariance pairs must be back-to-back at one tree state.
- ORIENTATION-ASSERT ADJUDICATION (§D/§E, onboarding wave): the glacis
  deck-descent heuristic misfires on hulls whose rear deck tops the bow
  run and on prints whose turret followers pollute the hull partition —
  a mismatch is a FLAG for deck-corner vertex adjudication, never an
  automatic block. PHOTOGRAMMETRY OUTLIER CRUSH: stray scan points
  inflate accessor min/max and every loader-parity consumer silently
  crushes the model — §E outlier-strip + min/max rebuild is MANDATORY
  before a scan oracle registers. DIMS-DATUM CLASS: when proc AND oracle
  both read mast-inclusive p95 above the published roof datum, a dims-0
  row is a datum-reconciliation work order, not a shape defect.

## §B3.1 addendum — MUZZLE BORE (owner directive 2026-08-06, with
## screenshot: "make tips of guns have holes, bruh")
No gun ends in a solid capped tip. Every muzzle face carries a visible
BORE: an annular rim at tube radius + a near-black bore disc recessed
2-4 cm inside the tube at ~0.55-0.70x tube radius (gunDark/void tone,
never camo). Muzzle BRAKES bore through the brake front face (and the
real side baffle windows already carry §B3.1). Reference collars/flash
hiders keep their rim grammar with the bore visible through. The disc is
interior to the tube silhouette by construction — mask-neutral from
side/plan; end-on it is the read the owner ordered. Applies fleet-wide:
MBT main guns, howitzers, autocannons (30/35mm — smaller disc), RARDEN,
MG muzzles at their scale (M2/NSVT get pinhole-class dark tips, not
drilled geometry). Graduates take the graduate-change flow (close-front
family views change).
- AO-WALL END-FACE CLIP CLASS (§B4, ww2 trio): factory layered-gear AO
  walls ending inside both wrap discs merge into a center-crossing clip
  candidate — end walls clear of the wrap poles (z ±2.50 class).
  RX-SIGN GENERALIZATION (§B1 mechanics): glacis furniture tilts are
  plate +rake / drum -(pi/2 - rake), derived per plate angle; aimed
  items (headlights) may keep aim on a riser — per-item judgment.
  FRUSTUM-BOTTOM-STRIP: silhouette-preserving split at the ramp line
  clears side-band bottoms from wrap sweeps.
- MUZZLE-BORE MECHANISM (§B3.1, leclerc round — MANDATORY for the fleet
  sweep): bucket-based bore rims grow the gun AABB ~3cm and re-frame the
  turret-row cameras (-6.2 measured) — implement bores as SHADOW-NAMED
  gun-group furniture (the misc.ts muzzleBore() helper pattern: dark rim
  torus + mats.shadow recessed disc parented to P.gunG) — renders in
  game/critic, excluded from every mask AND framing recipe; gates
  byte-identical by construction. Corollaries: HARNESS-HIDES-SHADOW-NAMED
  (evidence tooling must re-show shadow-named nodes for crops);
  FITTING-CAP TAIL (whatsat the fitting AABB per slot before seating);
  KIT.torus lies flat (rotate for vertical rings).

## §C.1 RENDER-TRUTH CHECKER (owner order 2026-08-06, t72b3m screenshot:
## "many parts of the turret that should be part of the turret are not
## there... we need checkers to make sure there arent erroneous stuf
## like this")
The gate CANNOT see this class (DoubleSide masks) while players CAN (the
game culls back-faces): reversed-winding pieces score perfectly and
vanish in game. A FLEET-WIDE official winding/render-truth audit is now
law: FrontSide-vs-DoubleSide comparison per tank across views (the
tmp-misc-leftprobe pattern promoted to an official tool), reporting
reversed/mixed slab counts + per-view pixel deficits, ranked worst-first
— run at every round close like track-clip. Named carriers at order
time: t72b3m (graduate! gate 91.8 while the game shows a bare turret),
challenger-line. Every profile binds mirrored slabs through a winding
guard (orientedSlab/sslab class) — this is now a standing §C check, not
a per-incident fix.
- §C.1 CORRECTION (owner, same day): the t72b3m case is §B5 YAW-STRANDING,
  not winding — "i rotate my turret and a lot of stuff that should be
  moving with it especially in back doesnt." The turret-parent audit reads
  0/0/0 on it, so the strands live in the audit's BLIND SPOTS (instanced
  meshes — ERA tiles — are not audited; merged-bucket AABB false
  negatives). The checker therefore gets a SECOND MODE: YAW-STRANDED
  pixel audit — render rest vs yaw-90/180 FrontSide, diff the turret
  footprint, flag mass that fails to rotate (instanced included). Both
  modes are standing round-close checks.
- §C.1 CHECKER LANDED (tools/winding-audit.{html,mjs} — official,
  self-ticketing, --check exit-codes): mode 1 winding census (mesh-level
  edge-balance + signed volume is AUTHORITATIVE; slab call-sites are
  hints only) + render deficit (FrontSide-vs-DoubleSide, the catch-all);
  mode 2 yaw-stranded (rest/90/180 plan diffs, per-pixel surface-height
  gate at ringY+0.20 — the DECK-AT-RING law — flat-id attribution,
  coincidencePx per §J). Standing classes: LATENT REVERSED-CORE
  (deficit-0 inside-out solids — HARD when render-visible), CASEMATE
  mode-2 by-design (coincidencePx 0 signature). Run at round close like
  track-clip; fleet baseline banked shots/winding-audit-fleet-20260806.

## §B8 OWNER ACCEPTANCE BAR — PROPORTIONS FIRST (owner directive
## 2026-08-06, with garage screenshot)
Owner verbatim: "i genuinely wont accept any tank that came from old era
and looks like this. it just doesnt look like a tank. honestly i dont
know how the puma or type 89 passed the bar, the propertions are wrong
and just dont look like their references." RULINGS: (1) builder
SELF-READS are NOT an acceptance bar — every photo-class/no-oracle build
requires an INDEPENDENT photo-parity critic verdict before it counts as
delivered (the same severity discipline as graduation critics); (2)
PROPORTIONS COME FIRST: before any detail work, the build must match the
real vehicle's gross form — hull length:width:height ratios vs published
dims, turret mass/position/size relative to hull, gun bore-line height,
wheel count/diameter/spacing, silhouette at a glance from 4 compass
views. A critic scores proportions as a GATING sub-verdict (proportion
FAIL = round FAIL regardless of detail quality); (3) the acid question
on every view is the owner's: "does it read as the real tank" — not
"is it decorated." Applies retroactively: all 2026-08-06 photo-class
landings (puma, type89, k2, type99a, ww2 trio, leo2a4, challenger2, t14,
leo2a7v, fv510) are DELIVERED-PENDING-CRITIC until adjudicated.

## §B3.1 addendum — MANTLETS MANDATORY (owner 2026-08-06: "make sure all
## tanks including russian tanks have mantlets" + "type 90 needs a
## mantlet")
Every gun run carries its REAL mantlet/gun-shield mass at the turret
face — the cast collar, boot, or shield the actual vehicle mounts (§B3.1
grammar; russian marks: the boot/collar classes from the prism sweep;
japanese type90: its distinctive flat armored mantlet plate). A bare
tube exiting a turret face with no mantlet mass is a failing read
fleet-wide. Critics: check every tank's gun root.

## §D addendum — SCALE/SIZE TRUE-UP (owner 2026-08-06: "make sure to
## scale and size tanks correctly, i think type 90 is too small")
dims=100 only proves the build matches ITS SPEC — the spec itself can be
wrong, and cross-tank scale reads in-game are the check the program
lacked. Standing audit: per tank compare spec dims against published
real-vehicle dims (type90 first: verify width/height/length vs the real
3.43w x 2.34h x 9.76 overall) AND eyeball garage lineups for relative
scale. Spec true-ups are orchestrator-lane, verify-first.

## §B8.1 PROPORTION GATES (from the 2026-08-06 acceptance slate — 0/12
## passed; envelope-parity is FALSE COMFORT: all 12 matched pub dims
## within ~4% and all failed the glance test)
Measurable gates, checked BEFORE detail (detail cannot rescue form —
freeze decoration until these pass):
1. WHEEL EXPOSURE: per-family exposure fraction (real 40-70%); "can't
   count the wheels in the left view" = auto-FAIL (9/12 failed this).
2. GLACIS PLANE: brief carries glacis run + nose-height TARGET NUMBERS —
   spec anchors the nose z but nothing else constrains the plane (8/12).
3. TURRET SHAPE LINE: face height + roof plane + one falsifiable
   family-shape line (drum vs wedge vs cast dome) — footprint ratios
   pass while the grammar is wrong-family (5/12).
4. STRUCTURE-MERGE ALARM: turretMass length > ~55% of hull length =
   alarm (the a7v read 77% and swings at yaw — also the §C.1 INVERSE
   case: the yaw checker flags turret-footprint mass OUTSIDE the ring
   envelope).
5. GEAR PATTERN: encode the arrangement (HVSS pairs, Tiger interleave,
   Christie spacing), not the count.
6. The four-box probe (overall/hull/turret/gun + rig_muzzle boxes vs
   targets) is a standing round-close check for photo-class builds.
- REGISTRATION-ANCHOR LAW (§D, t90m round): body-span-extreme edits shift
  dAlong half a column and INVALIDATE every prior digest target — freeze
  the span extremes first, or re-derive all targets after any end edit.
  TEETER CO-LOCATION: teeter columns cluster at shared grid phases —
  fix them as a family. VERTEX-SCAN BLINDNESS (§C): world-box vertex
  scans cannot attribute merged/instanced content — AABB census +
  fitting tags are the attribution tools.
- STATION WHOLE-SLAB LAW (§D, moderns round): station slices render the
  WHOLE model per z-slab — turret-rear masts own hull-station tops; only
  the 2-slice trim absorbs a print's antenna spike. EXTRACT-FOLLOWER
  POLLUTION: extract hull rows include turretFollower content — author
  hull rows from the LIVE workorder, never extract hull curves.
  END-DRUM TUCK vs SPONSON (§B4): re-tucking end drums raises shoe
  orbits into full-width deck bands — split bands wrap-safe (spine +
  sponson floors + outer walls) BEFORE drum re-seats. DECAL FLOAT =
  PHANTOM COLUMN (§C): unpinned decals read as silhouette columns —
  asymmetric top reads are the tell.
- FLAT-SLAB GLACIS BUG (§B8.1 gate-2 mechanics, IFV rework): a "raked
  plane" authored with BOTH frustum rings spanning the full bow z is a
  flat slab with a near-vertical face — author bottom-ring-at-nose /
  top-ring-at-crest so the front face IS the plane; check ring spans on
  any one-plane claim. GLACIS-FURNITURE rx SIGN: descending-toward-+z
  planes take POSITIVE rx for flush plates. §B4 budgets clear the
  SHOE-STACK envelope (pin caps included), not the band apex. GATE
  FLOATERS = projected islands: stalked furniture needs >=10px-projected
  brackets at gate resolution.
- SHADOW-TONE PHYSICS (§C, revolution gray fix): raw-clone shadow
  furniture renders unmovable black (no ambient floor — rehook before
  grading); grade DIRECTION is physics (top-dark under overhangs,
  bounce-lit at the deck); and NO TONE PASS RESCUES AN OVERSIZED VOID —
  a 0.4m band needs real geometry (§B7 apron) + an honest slit.
  FITTING-CAP heightM p95: wide-span roof fittings own the p95 across
  columns — whatsat the fitting AABB before seating roof weapons on
  published-height builds.
- DETAIL-SLOT LOUD-CARRIER (§C, t90m adjudication): the mats.detail
  default is wheelTone-coupled TAN — profiles hanging large equipment on
  it must retint/re-bucket (t72b3m did; t90m's drums did not).
  INTERIOR-READ TRIAD: wheel exposure, hatch rings, and equipment tone
  are mask-invisible — §B8.1 wheel-countability applies to ORACLE-BACKED
  graduations too, judged vs the oracle render on every side pair.
  HASH-IMPL PINNING: tmp-hashgeo's float64-saturating FNV defines the
  recorded hashes — byte-identical arithmetic or no comparison.
- NATIVE-TONE SCORING (§B8.1 gate-1, leopard resit): equalized crops
  rescue tonally-dead geometry — the a4's "buried" wheels were exposed
  inside an ambient-black void; score wheel-countability at NATIVE tone.
  MID-GRAY FLAT (50-58) is pipeline-endemic and distinct from the
  owner's <=35 zero-variance defect class; dark camo patches mimic the
  signature (organic fill + paint-edge context separate them). Bore
  crops are excluded from rectangle verdicts.
- TONE-SLOT MECHANICS (§C, t90m r8): REPAINT-REGISTERED SLOTS
  (wheels/wheelsDark/detail) ignore retints — dead code; the AMBIENT
  FLOOR pins hooked vertical faces at ~52L (sub-40 targets need unhooked
  clones); small carriers re-bucketed to camo sample ONE PATCH (lottery
  — use cloth/steel slots); sample TOP views before accepting roof tones
  (warm-key flip). ORACLE-RENDER HEM SEMANTICS (§D): decode the ref's
  below-hem tone runs per column before authoring any curtain — the
  t90m ref's "curtain" was its wheels' lit upper arcs.

## §K. QUALITY EXEMPLARS (owner ratification 2026-08-07 — the fleet bar)
Owner verbatim: "our exact modelling-replicating/generating procedures
are going pretty well. the leclerc turret is a triumph in this way, as
are the merkava geometries. all tank designs have to aim for this
level of quality."
THE EXEMPLARS and what made them:
- The LECLERC TURRET FRONT (France round, 206c5fd1): the print's
  profile was MEASURED (vertex-workorder columns), the old
  approximation replaced by the true two-stage loft (tall lean plate
  -> the small flat brow strip -> one long raked face), and a
  tempting-but-wrong bulge was BUILT, MEASURED, and REVERTED with the
  receipt banked. Exact replication over invention.
- The MERKAVA GEOMETRIES (§5.11 wave): every under-roof volume closed
  with SOLID CASTING SHAPES that read as the vehicle's own armor
  surfaces (wedge walls rising with the roof, crest saddles, chin
  fills) — zero gate regressions, verified at four turret yaws.
THE LAW: every round on every tank aims for this level — measure the
real profile first, loft to the measured lines, close volumes with
real geometry, prove it in pixels (owner-angle + yaw sweeps), and bank
reverted experiments as receipts. Critics: hold acid reads to the
exemplar standard; "close enough" silhouettes that would not survive
the leclerc-turret comparison are orders.

### §K.1 LECLERC-METHOD FLEET APPLICATION (owner, 2026-08-08)
The Leclerc result is now an explicit construction method, not merely a
quality reference. For every tank needing geometry work: (1) inventory the
oracle by connected component and measured longitudinal/cross-width stations;
(2) reproduce the real silhouette with joined station lofts, keeping separate
roof, brow, cheek, bustle, and rack planes instead of averaging them into
boxes; (3) preserve real asymmetry, gaps, and per-variant equipment stations;
(4) normalize only the axis constrained by a ratified P95 datum, never the
measured x/z footprint; (5) compare the same 14 reference/procedural views
after each meaningful change, and reject any experiment that improves detail
while worsening the gross form or gate. Raw oracle height is not authority
when it violates the published P95 law: map that height into the certified
band and retain its measured plan/rake, as proven by K2 Object_8/Object_18.

Named priority applications: Challenger 2, Challenger 3, the full T-90 family,
and AbramsX. AbramsX is a COMPLETE REDESIGN against both local reference kits,
not a dressing pass or an inheritance of its prior visual re-cert. It follows
the K2/Leclerc measured-loft sequence before lower-priority cleanup or K1A1.

### §K.2 STATION-SECTION DISCIPLINE (Challenger 3 graduation lesson)
The Leclerc method measures section width and section height independently;
never force a circular primitive when the oracle carries an oval jacket,
flattened fairing, or anisotropic casting. Challenger 3's L55A1 root sleeve
needed its full 370 mm plan width but only a 230 mm side height, so an oval
section matched both views where either circular diameter failed one. A
one-pixel thickness error repeated along a long tube is systematic mass, not
AA noise: tune the physical section until the entire raster band agrees.

Likewise, preserve view-specific station truth without duplicating masses:
two laterally separated whips may share one longitudinal side-view station,
and a broad armor plane that intersects the track envelope must be re-lofted
at the measured knee rather than excused by its passing silhouette. Every
joined loft therefore closes on three receipts together: source station
curves, 14 shaded comparisons, and band-plus-shoe containment with no blind
spot. This section law applies next to Challenger 2 and every T-90 rebuild.

### §K.3 DIRECT-TREE COMPONENT FIDELITY (Challenger 2 graduation lesson)
Component fidelity scores the articulated hull and turret trees directly.
`whole - hull` is retained only as an exposed-band diagnostic: it changes
when two otherwise matching models overlap the ring/deck by a few centimetres
and can therefore report a false component failure while their direct trees
and every whole view agree. A repaired oracle must expose true hull, turret,
and gun nodes before this rule applies; fused references remain whole-mask
only. Graduation still requires the independent geometry components, the
whole-view floor, and the fourteen-view critic—direct-tree scoring cannot
average away any of those gates.

### §K.4 SOURCE-EXACT FITTINGS + LOCAL CLOSURE (Challenger 2 lesson)
A generic fitting constructor is a vocabulary default, not permission to
replace a better source measurement. When the oracle carries a variant-
specific receiver, cradle, folded weapon or other assembly whose already-
certified exterior cannot fit the generic envelope, keep its real component
geometry together in one visible group and register that group through the
same fitting marker/AABB contract. The group must contain real visible
meshes; marker-only census escapes are forbidden. Challenger 2's folded
transverse L7A2/MAG proves the class: substituting the generic upright MAG
dropped the geometry floor to 89.5, while marking the exact receiver+tube
preserved the certified mask byte-for-byte and made the fitting census
truthful.

Likewise, a plan-contiguity hole is closed with the smallest source-owned
hardpoint, seam, bracket or plate that actually occupies that location.
Never flood the surrounding recess with a broad fill merely to satisfy the
census. On Challenger 2, a narrow x=±1.12 rear-shoulder hardpoint closed both
4x4 sky wells with the 90.1 gate unchanged; the broad shoulder fill was
built, measured at 89.5, and rejected. Exact fitting census, contiguity,
geometry gate and shaded comparison are one coupled receipt.
