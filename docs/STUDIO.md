# Scene Studio

Scene Studio is a game mode for composing and recording scenes with the current
renderer. It loads the selected battlefield, including terrain, vegetation,
props, sky, lighting, and post-processing, without running combat AI, spotting,
or the battle HUD. Users can place vehicles, set pose and damage state, schedule
game effects, operate a free camera, define camera and vehicle tracks, edit a
20-second timeline, record browser video, and capture high-resolution stills.

Implementation: `src/game/studioAccess.ts` (retryable chunk/FX acquisition,
stable frame proxy, and temporary F8 ownership), `src/game/studio.ts` (runtime
and `window.__STUDIO`), `src/game/studioTimeline.ts` (pure storyboard
normalization and sampling), and `src/ui/studioPanel.ts` (panel interface).
`main.ts` supplies integration ports and retains only the Studio `tick()`
composition branch.

## Entering / leaving

| Path | How |
|---|---|
| URL | `/studio?map=desert` or legacy `?studio=1&map=desert` — boots directly into Studio |
| Garage | **F8** (toggle; also the panel's EXIT button) |
| Script | `window.__STUDIO.enter({ map })` / `window.__STUDIO.exit()` |
| Leave | F8 / Esc / EXIT → back to the garage |

Battle vehicle visuals remain hidden while Studio is active. Exiting Studio
restores them and returns control through the normal garage entry. This also
clears camouflage overrides and restores the pedestal key.

Direct navigation uses a dedicated load path. The inline boot screen remains
visible while the battlefield and Studio effect resources load in parallel.
This path does not display the garage or warm the complete battle roster,
wreck, and shadow resources.
Runtime entry from the garage and map changes use the shared transition screen
with measured world-build progress. `window.__STUDIO_LOAD`, `__STUDIO_WARM`, and
`__WORLD_LOAD` expose the most recent stage timings for diagnostics.

Under WebDriver or the `?nogate` parameter, the boot input prompt closes
automatically so headless capture tools can enter Studio.

## Interactive controls

- **LMB-drag** on the world: look around without pointer lock
- **WASD** fly, **Q/E** down/up, **Shift** 4× speed, **wheel** dolly
  (orbit mode: wheel = distance)
- **Click terrain**: move the effect marker (amber ring)
- **Click a tank**: select · **drag a tank**: move it and update terrain alignment
- **Space**: play/pause the storyboard · **Delete**: remove the selected effect
  (or selected actor when no effect layer is selected)
- The panel provides a scrollable workspace with **Battlefield**, **Tanks**,
  **Effects**, **Cinematics**, and **Output** sections. Add camera shots at the
  playhead, set a keyframe after positioning the selected tank, and then scrub
  or play the timeline. **Direct 12 s Duel** configures the first two staged
  tanks as a recordable moving battle. Map previews load when the battlefield
  picker opens. Scene JSON can be downloaded, uploaded, copied, or stored in
  three local slots; Shift-click saves to a slot. The Output section also opens
  the shared 88-frame archive for composition, lighting, effects, and vehicle
  placement reference.

The archive drawer uses the same `src/presentation/mediaArchive.ts` component as
the landing page, public field manual, and Tank Gallery. It reads the checked-in
showcase manifest and loads its compact image rail only when opened, so the 88
reference frames do not add image transfers to Studio startup.

## `window.__STUDIO` (scripted-shoot contract)

```js
await __STUDIO.load(sceneJson)      // deterministic build → returns state()
__STUDIO.capture(opts)              // {dataURL, width, height} hi-res PNG
await __STUDIO.recordVideo(opts)    // plays once → {blob, size, mimeType, durationMs}
__STUDIO.listActors()               // [{index, uid, name, id, pos, facingDeg, …, state}]
__STUDIO.state()                    // round-trippable scene JSON (see schema)
```

Additional methods used by the panel:

```js
__STUDIO.enter({map}) / .exit() / .setMap(mapId)      // async
__STUDIO.addActor(cfg) / .updateActor(ref, patch) / .removeActor(ref)
__STUDIO.setActorState(ref, state, ageS?) / .selectActor(ref) / .clearActors()
__STUDIO.setHydropneumaticAim(ref, pitchDeg)          // real siege-suspension settle
__STUDIO.effect({type, actor|at, params})             // fire one effect NOW
__STUDIO.listEffects()                               // authored FX layers + stable ids
__STUDIO.selectEffect(id) / .removeEffect(id)        // select/delete one layer
__STUDIO.updateEffect(id, {tMs})                     // retime a layer
__STUDIO.clearEffects()                               // reset fx timeline (keeps actors)
__STUDIO.advanceFx(ms) / .seek(ms)                    // scrub/step the timeline
__STUDIO.setTimeScale(v) / .timeScale / .fxTimeMs
__STUDIO.play() / .pause() / .stop()
__STUDIO.getStoryboard() / .setStoryboard(board) / .setStoryboardDuration(ms)
__STUDIO.addCameraShot(cfg?) / .updateCameraShot(id, patch) / .removeCameraShot(id)
__STUDIO.keyActor(ref, cfg?) / .clearActorTrack(ref)
__STUDIO.setRailVisible(on) / .directDuel()
__STUDIO.recordVideo(opts) / .stopRecording() / .recordingStatus()
__STUDIO.setCamera(cfg) / .getCamera()
__STUDIO.TANK_IDS / .MAP_IDS / .ACTOR_STATES / .EFFECT_TYPES / .CAMO_PATTERN_IDS
__STUDIO.getMapInfo(id)             // {id, name}
__STUDIO.getSpecInfo(id)            // {name, gunElevationDeg, gunDepressionDeg, shells}
__STUDIO.performance()              // rendered/skipped frame + pool-sweep counters
__STUDIO.active / .mapId
```

`setHydropneumaticAim` is available only for vehicles whose spec defines a
hydropneumatic aiming system. It advances the fixed-step movement solver, seats
the sprung hull through compression and droop, and settles the deformable wheel
and track course before returning pitch and wheel-stagger telemetry.

Actor `ref` = `uid` (`"a1"`), `name`, roster index, or the actor object.
Effect `ref` = stable effect `id` (`"fx1"`), stack index, or the returned
effect object.

### capture(opts)

`{ width?, height?, scale?, download?, name?, type?, quality? }` → renders the
current frame once at the requested resolution (renderer + full post chain
temporarily resized at pixelRatio 1, all shadow cascades forced, `dt = 0`) and
returns `{ dataURL, width, height }`. Default width =
`max(2560, 2 × viewport)` at the live aspect; height defaults to the aspect.
Clamped to the GPU max texture size (≤ 6144). `download: true` also saves the
PNG from the browser. Headless drivers read `dataURL` and write the file
themselves (see `tools/studio-selftest.mjs`).

### recordVideo(opts)

`{ fps?, videoBitsPerSecond?, mimeType?, download?, name? }` records the live
postprocessed renderer canvas while the storyboard plays once from zero to its
bounded duration. Defaults: 60 fps, 12 Mbps, best supported WebM codec,
`download: true`. The storyboard schema clamps every production to 1–20
seconds. The result is `{ blob, size, mimeType, durationMs }`. Recording hides
the camera rail and pauses on the final frame. The video contains the rendered
picture only; Studio does not currently mix game audio into the capture stream.

### Effect types

Anchor: `actor` (position resolved at fire time, `hFrac` optional height
fraction) or `at: [x, z]` / `[x, y, z]` (2-form solves y from terrain). With
neither, the panel marker (or the ground ahead of the camera) is used.

| type | needs | params | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fire` | actor | `slot` (shell index), `tracer` (default true), `recoil` (default true) | Complete firing event with muzzle flash, APFSDS sabot petals, recoil, projectile travel, and terrain impact. |
| `muzzle_flash` | actor or point | `caliberMm`, `dirDeg` (point form) | flash + smoke ring + ground dust only |
| `tracer` | `from:[x,y,z]`, `to:[x,y,z]` | `shellType` (AP/APCR/APFSDS/HEAT/HE), `speedMps`, `caliberMm` | Projectile entity traveling between two points; `fxTime` can freeze it in flight. |
| `impact` | point/actor | `kind` (pen/nonpen/ricochet/he_pen/he_splash/era/spaced_absorb/terrain), `caliberMm`, `normal:[x,y,z]` | Armor or terrain impact effect. |
| `sparks` | point/actor | `caliberMm` | ricochet spark fan (alias of impact ricochet) |
| `explosion` | point/actor | `size`: `small` (HE dirt plume) / `medium` (destruction, no rack) / `large` (full ammo-rack fireball + debris + smoke column), `cause` | standalone explosion |
| `tank_kill` | actor | `cause` (ammorack/shot/fire), `pop` (default true) | Destruction sequence with a fireball, debris, smoke column, wreck transition, and optional turret detachment. |
| `dust` | point/actor | `count`, `intensity`, `dirDeg` | Dust burst using the track-dust effect. |
| `engine_smoke` | actor | `off` | Additive continuous smoke from the engine deck, including on wreck meshes. |
| `burning` | actor | `off` | Additive keyed fire and smoke column over the current mesh state. |
| `detrack` | actor | `side`: `L`/`R` | thrown-track visual + link/spark/dust burst |
| `firing_moment` | actor | `ageS` (default 0.05), `caliberMm`, `shellType` | the composed frozen firing still (contract `combat_firing` language) |
| `explosion_moment` | point/actor | `ageS` (default 0.6) | the composed frozen destruction still |
| `mg_burst` | actor | `count` (default 7), `gapM` (chain spacing, default 7), `spreadDeg`, `caliberMm` (default 12.7), `speedMps` | Coaxial machine-gun flash and a deterministic sequence of small-caliber tracers along the gun line. |
| `barrage` | point/actor | `count` (default 5), `radiusM` (default 10), `size`: `small`/`medium`/`mixed` (default), `seedDeg` | Deterministic ring of artillery ground bursts around the anchor. |
| `armor_scar` | actor | `count` (default 4), `caliberMm` (default 100), `seedDeg` | Persistent impact decals placed around the hull at fixed bearings and heights. |
| `exhaust` | actor | `count` (default 14), `intensity` (default 0.95), `sooty` (default true) | Exhaust burst from the engine deck at the continuous emitter anchor. |

### Determinism contract

`load()`:
1. enters/switches to `map` (chunked build, cached per map),
2. waits for every started GLB swap to settle (`waitModels: false` in the
   second argument skips this), re-conforms poses after swaps,
3. resets the fx system (`resetAll` + `resetSeed(seed)`), studio clock to 0,
4. builds actors in order; poses conform to terrain through the movement
   module's support calculation (zero-input handbrake settle), then the
   authored facing/turret/gun values are pinned exactly,
5. applies the camera,
6. samples actor motion tracks and the camera rail at the requested playhead,
7. fires effects sorted by `tMs`, advancing the shared fx clock between them
   in fixed 1/60 s steps (the same cadence used during play; smoke
   columns, engine smoke, shell flight and light/ring timelines all age
   through their runtime update paths),
8. advances to exactly `fxTime` and freezes (`timeScale 0` unless the JSON
   says otherwise). Wind is pinned to a deterministic phase.

The same JSON input produces the same frame. Effects with `tMs > fxTime` remain scheduled in
`state()` and fire automatically when preview or recording crosses their time.
Camera rails use Catmull-Rom spatial interpolation for `smooth` arrivals;
`linear` and `cut` are available per shot. Actor keys use shortest-arc angular
interpolation and terrain-following presentation with moving track links.

When the timeline is frozen, an unchanged Studio frame is render-on-demand:
camera/actor/effect/resize changes invalidate it, while idle animation,
world updates, lighting, and post-processing are skipped. A nonzero time scale
continues to render normally.

`state()` returns the schema above (actors in creation order with their
current pose/state, the effect stack with stable `id` + authored `tMs`, the current camera,
`fxTime` = current clock). `load(state())` round-trips.

Effects are individually removable even after they have emitted pooled
particles or changed a tank presentation. Studio restores each actor's
authored baseline (serialized as `authoredState`, `authoredSmoking`,
`authoredBurning`, and authored age/recoil fields only when it differs from
the visible state), resets the FX pools, and deterministically replays the
remaining stack to the same `fxTime`. This is why deleting engine smoke,
burning, a tracer, a detrack, or a kill leaves no orphaned visual state.

## Known limitations

- **Camo is per-spec**: two actors of the same tank id share one paint bake
  (`camo`/`camoSeed` of the most recent application wins). Different specs are
  fully independent.
- Wrecked and burning states do not run the combat simulation. They do not
  calculate damage or module state.
- `timeOfDayish` is accepted but ignored (sun/sky presets are authored per
  map; re-lighting would need a sky re-bake).
- The garage bay set-dressing physically exists at the map edge (−1500,−1500)
  and can be framed if you fly there.
- Studio `fire` shells collide with terrain only (props/tanks don't stop
  them). A standalone `tracer` stops at its authored `to` point.
- Engine smoke and burning effects with `timeScale > 0` use the current render
  cadence. The frozen composition path (`load`/`advanceFx`) remains deterministic.
- Video capture does not include audio and uses the browser's available MediaRecorder
  codec. Encoded bytes are not expected to be identical across browsers.

## Self-test

`tools/studio-selftest.mjs` starts Vite on an available 7xxx port and uses
Puppeteer to enter `?studio=1&map=desert`. It loads a three-tank scene with
firing, destruction, wreck, dust, and engine-smoke states. The test verifies
the dedicated Studio boot path, confirms that battle simulation is disabled,
checks the frozen `fxTime`, captures PNG files at 2560 pixels or wider on two
maps, and verifies scene JSON round-trip behavior. It also creates the 12-second
duel, checks camera, vehicle, and effect tracks, seeks to the knockout event,
verifies scheduled playback, and records a non-empty one-second WebM file.
`src/game/studioTimeline.selftest.mjs` separately covers duration clamps,
normalization, rails, cuts, and actor interpolation. Output:
`shots/studio-selftest/*.png`.

Render the pinned 20-video modern-MBT example set with:

```bash
npm run studio:examples -- --out shots/studio-modern-examples
```

The batch tool validates both actors as `modern`/`mbt`, records the current
canvas path at 1280×720, and writes WebM files plus `manifest.json` under the
gitignored output directory. Use `--only 3,7,11` to render selected pinned
scenario numbers. The pinned set avoids the urban center because its buildings
can occlude a generic two-tank camera rail.
