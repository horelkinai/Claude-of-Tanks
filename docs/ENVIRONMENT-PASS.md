# Environment pass — September 2026

This document preserves the original pass and its historical evidence. Some
temporary outputs referenced below were later lost. Current recovery,
publication and acceptance status lives in
[ENVIRONMENT-RECOVERY.md](ENVIRONMENT-RECOVERY.md); do not interpret older
“not pushed” notes or missing capture paths as the current release state.

## Objective and visual reference

Upgrade all existing battlefields, ground and mountain materials, horizons,
skies, vegetation and ambient detail; add ten distinct complete battlefields.
Natural shorelines must agree with rendered terrain and driving interaction.
The requested quality reference is the layered, inhabited landscape in
[Cosy Japan](https://x.com/0xpaulius/status/2095627800027820498), with World of
Tanks as an aspirational visual comparison. A numeric test does not prove
visual parity with that game.

## Baseline

Isolated implementation branch: `codex/environment-pass-r1`.
Starting production revision: `da5e0cf0a`.
Release integration is isolated on `codex/environment-release-r1`, based on
`2c22d203d`; it preserves the later vehicle fleet, owner-approved media,
HUD role icons and corrected spectator mouse/minimap handedness. The authored
environment checkpoint is `23b82f0bc`; it has not been pushed while final
integrated resource/performance checks remain open. Final all-map artwork
generation and native-frame review are complete (V16, below).

- Original visual survey: `/private/tmp/cot-environment-baseline/`.
  Its schema-1 timing sampled browser callbacks, including skipped draws, and
  is not valid renderer-throughput evidence.
- All twenty original maps, actual rendered-frame sampling and recorded
  camera poses: `/private/tmp/cot-environment-baseline-v2/` (90 frames,
  three repeats). This exploratory run overlaps host activity and predates
  the shared capture lock; final performance certification must use the lock.
- Production Garage → battle → Garage residency:
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-resources-baseline.json`.
- Visual defects confirmed: overdriven turf relief, dry-soil normals reaching
  water, bleached leaf-card edges, straight horizon curtains and UV seams,
  disconnected round ponds in river layouts.
- Candidate all-thirty-map capture: `/private/tmp/cot-environment-candidate-v2/`.
  No page errors; timing gates failed on nine maps and the initial blanket
  loose-body-count gate failed on four. These are exploratory results, not
  release approval. Matched follow-ups are in `candidate-v3` and `candidate-v4`
  under the same `/private/tmp/cot-environment-` prefix.
- Serialized pristine timing baseline completed at
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-baseline-v3/`, with actual rendered frames,
  fixed viewport, three repeats and the shared capture lock. All twenty maps
  rendered without page errors from clean revision `da5e0cf0a`. The new
  placement-receipt quality check does not apply to that unmodified baseline.
- All-thirty-map V5 validation completed at
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-candidate-v5/`: timing compares with baseline-v3,
  while visual viewpoints are pinned independently to candidate-v2 poses.
  All placement/grounding gates pass and there are no page errors. Performance
  fails on Verdant, Delta and Badlands; no map adds textures or materials.
  This is not release approval: the visual/terrain review below found further
  defects, and the three timing failures still require controlled comparison.
- V6 targeted rendered checks completed at
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-candidate-v6/` for Fjord, winter, Autumn,
  Polders, Mangrove and Monsoon. All six maps report six successful sourced
  texture receipts, no page errors, and passing placement gates. This run
  has no timing-baseline comparison and is not a performance approval.
  Matched shots remain unchanged; `water-current` is separate evidence at a
  current-height camera, and each pose now records terrain clearance.
  Four-quadrant views expose all sides of the alpine ranges.
- Water roughness A/B completed at `/private/tmp/cot-water-gloss-v7/` for
  Autumn and coastal. The 0.22 liquid roughness floor replaces the broad
  0.54 satin response: matched Autumn close-ups show a tighter sun highlight
  and darker off-highlight water. Frozen ice retains its previous floor.
  These short, source-development captures are visual evidence only.
- V8 seven-map and V9 nine-map native visual checks are retained at
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-candidate-v8/` and
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-candidate-v9/`. V9 has no page errors, but
  uses only 30 frames and one repeat: it is not a performance certificate.
  Review confirms irregular smaller snowdrifts, golden separated crop rows,
  blue-green Oasis water and less wall-like alpine/mesa profiles. Skybridge
  remains deliberately stylized; its broad angular mesas are an improvement
  over the previous thin spires, not evidence of photorealism. Final native-4K
  review initially rejected their narrow triangular summit profiles.
  V12/V14 now confirm finite-area caps on Skybridge only, with unchanged
  horizon vertex/index, texture and random-sampling budgets. Unsupported wet
  rail segments are omitted at construction, preserving dry geometry and
  subsequent RNG exactly; three-seed washout coverage and V14 agree.
- A strict pristine production eviction sweep of all twenty original maps
  three times is recorded at
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-client-residency-pristine20.json`.
  All 58 expected evictions occur and no browser/resource errors occur, but
  the memory gate FAILS: each measured repeat retains another 260 GPU
  textures, about 375 MiB of managed heap and 1,811 MiB of backing storage.
  This is a valid failed baseline, not acceptable warm-up. Candidate cleanup
  must independently demonstrate a bounded plateau before release.
- The fresh original-twenty-map countdown-acquisition baseline is complete:
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-client-residency-pristine20-lookahead-v1.json`.
  All 60 checkpoints prove the exact production terrain warm queue was drained
  and stayed unchanged through actual rendered frames. Geometry and program
  repeat counts are now stable; the baseline still fails all twenty repeated
  texture/managed/backing/embedder memory checks (80 failures), including
  another 260 textures per cycle. It is retained as a valid failed baseline,
  not relabeled as acceptable warm-up.

## Implementation and required evidence

| Requirement | Implementation | Evidence and remaining qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ground/material quality | Bounded normal relief and separation of soil/water | Targeted near/mid/grazing reviews and final all-thirty-map native stills pass; motion review remains separate |
| Natural bodies of water | Shared seeded concave shoreline; connected river stations | Overhead/bank reviews, wet-mask/grade/ford checks and current collision/minimap exports pass |
| Mountains and horizon | Closed UV seam, redistributed radial topology, smooth normals, coastal opening | All-thirty-map native skyline review passes; simplified distant geometry remains a disclosed visual limit |
| Sky and atmosphere | Coherent periodic cloud bake and lower cloud bank | Stable pan and horizon captures on desktop/mobile |
| Vegetation | Matte diffuse-only leaf wrap; compensated bark albedo; coherent snow caps and a smooth strip within the existing atlas | Matched Verdant/winter review passes; all-biome/LOD/motion and resource checks remain |
| Ambient detail | Existing inhabited prop vocabulary plus eight biome sound profiles | Native Chrome audio passes eight profiles: pre-limiter peak 0.198–0.348, RMS 0.031–0.046, exact silence after teardown. Subjective listening remains unverified; WAVs and report are in `/private/tmp/cot-ambient-native/` |
| Ten complete new maps | Polders, Copper Mesa, Airfield, Oasis, Whiteout, Orchard, Longleaf, Mangrove, Saltwind, Reservoir | All rendered/reviewed; catalogs/random/private/ranked integration, route/cover/spawn and server collision checks pass; canonical pacing passes with disclosed timeouts |
| No performance regression | Same-size texture families, smaller horizon geometry, no extra terrain samplers | Matched all-map timing, worst-frame and constrained-device results |
| No memory regression | Explicit shader-only terrain/horizon/prop texture ownership; all CSM-registered prop materials tracked; per-map server JSON and bounded terrain ownership | Final thirty-map server sweep has zero repeated ArrayBuffer growth and 3,176 bytes heap growth; native client phase/eviction plateau remains required |
| Public readiness | Generated previews, minimaps, collision manifest, metadata | Native artwork and 497 applicable tests pass through the documented combined runs; production build/typecheck pass; performance/memory gates and verified push remain open |

This is a work ledger. The objective remains active until the requirements
above have direct current-state evidence; source changes alone are incomplete.

## Findings from the all-map rendered review

- Interpolated horizon rows could cross radially. The corrected bounded
  interpolation retains the exact geometry budget; a second macro-profile
  pass replaces one continuous rising wall with separated crests and saddles.
  V4 confirms improved depth, but also exposes treeline ribbons bridging
  different skyline ranges. Cross-range connections are now omitted without
  adding geometry; V5 confirms that the airborne bridging strips are gone.
- Grass cards used identical straight-up normals. A shallow directional fan
  now varies shading within the existing normal buffers; palette, dimensions,
  placement stream, materials and shader cost are unchanged.
- New biome IDs fell back to the sourced Verdant texture plan, overriding
  snow/sand authoring with grass. Explicit existing terrain/building palette
  selection and inherited grass-tone hooks now cover all ten new maps.
- Lightweight timber/metal structures had overdriven Sobel normal strength.
  V4 confirms corrugated sheds no longer alternate black and white. Neutral
  albedo textures and their 128-square dimensions are unchanged. The separate
  charred-looking timber palette has been lifted to weathered wood; its new
  native V16 review now covers the lifted timber palette without a blocking
  frontage or texture defect.
- Tactical structures outside the village could intersect trees because
  vegetation was built first. Construction-only crown/lean/structure-envelope
  compaction now removes matching visuals, spotting and collision together,
  without spending more placement attempts or changing the random stream.
- Liquid marsh materials were draped over hills. A bounded construction-time
  plane policy now supports shared river levels and horizontal ponds. Focused
  wet-mask, dry-ford and grade tests pass (3,039 water samples). A small spatial
  index bounds the expanded river-station queries; exact construction timings
  remain mixed under host variance, so this is not a blanket performance pass.
  Polders and Mangrove use explicitly leveled channel reaches. The Airfield now
  stamps a 36-by-760-metre graded paved strip into the existing road grids,
  with full-width/corner checks and no extra texture or live-query branch.
- Fifty loose physics bodies was not a meaningful universal decoration target:
  maps author roadside sites, each with one or two loose objects. The audit now
  requires actual construction receipts, at least 85% authored-site placement
  and five distinct loose kinds, retaining independent building, destructible,
  wreck and grounding floors. This does not prove equivalence for Fjord's
  observed 66-to-49 total-body change. Final V16 Fjord placement/render review
  passes, but does not claim numerical equivalence to that old body count.
- V5 reveals remaining Fjord/winter near-horizon curtains: the buried seam's
  outer skirt, deliberately unchanged in the earlier pass, rises too abruptly.
  V6 confirms a lower, recessed skirt and separated passes. It still shows
  stretched cliff detail: altitude-only V coordinates collapse at crests and
  saddles. Alpine atlas color is now altitude-only biome tint, while texture
  uses the existing world-triplanar samples with fewer fetches. V9 exposed a
  second independent cause in postprocessing: the single oblique projection
  becomes nearly singular on east/north-facing cliffs (measured condition
  number above 10,000). An arcade-only bypass was tested as a diagnostic;
  it is not the final behavior. V11 uses a
  continuous four-corner world-volume noise field, preserving the original
  detail weights, chroma and amplitude. Four arcade quadrants and four actual
  x8 authored scope probes show useful detail without directional fibers or
  obvious noise seams. The scene budget is unchanged; arcade skips its
  zero-weight finest octave (12 hashes rather than 16), scope retains 16.
  Extra ranking arithmetic still requires matched performance measurement.
  Magnified pale ridge bands and broad faceted silhouettes remain limitations,
  not a claim of photorealistic mountains.
- Independent lake-bank probes found 224.5% maximum grade on Polders and
  195.8% on Mangrove. The original liquid test sampled only marshes, silently
  skipping both lake-based maps. Adaptive liquid-lake banks now pass 15,066
  wet samples across two seeds (maximum sampled grade 0.396), including
  explicit nonzero lake coverage and harbor-frontage checks. V6 confirms the
  softer banks; frozen sheets do not use this policy.
- Amberford's river previously contained disconnected pond links. Its
  52-station channel now overlaps between the three preserved dry fords;
  V6 overhead evidence confirms continuous reaches.
- Water's painted foam strokes were also reused as height, producing embossed
  scratches at near and macro scales. Pigment-independent shallow waves now
  reuse the same two 256-square textures, omit the intermediate painting
  canvas, and keep ice's crack/pressure response unchanged. Pixel tests pass;
  V6 confirms that the bright engraved scratches are gone. The pixel test
  checks generated CPU pixels, not native upload or complete fragment shading.
- Authoring capture did not await the already-exposed sourced-texture promise.
  Capture-only readiness, strict scene-minimap receipts, and native-4K source
  guards now pass focused tests and V6 native sourced-texture checks. The final
  public asset refresh is complete in V16, with Delta's small V17 update below.
- The new Oasis, Polders, Mangrove and Reservoir water cells now form distinct
  hooked/branching reaches or irregular engineered compartments. V8 overheads
  are accepted for layout. Polders has five leveled retention compartments,
  not one continuously connected canal; Reservoir is a lobed upland basin,
  not a narrow tributary network. Product copy reflects those distinctions.
- V6 Polders exposed crop rows crossing wet banks. Segment-level support and
  wet-ground rejection now preserve the placement random stream while
  reducing geometry where clipped. V9 also confirms that the revised atlas
  no longer creates dense pale crop walls; atlas size and paint RNG are fixed.
- Skybridge's mesa mask previously occupied the same blue channel required
  for water, preventing liquid gameplay coverage from rendering. Water/ice
  now take priority over optional landform rock gating; geometric slope still
  controls rock. Overlapping automatic lake levels share a flat outlet and
  V9 confirms visible continuous liquid. A later road-edge detail pass was
  also deforming fully wet ground; canonical wet coverage now suppresses that
  detail without a second contour traversal. Strict 18-metre road-exclusion
  tests retain 482 exact flat-join checks rather than widening the exclusion.
- Old snowdrifts were flattened spheres, producing pale oval stickers. A
  deterministic irregular 97-vertex drift meets the ground and buries its
  perimeter, reducing each drift from 432 to 168 triangles. V9 winter
  screenshots confirm the outline improvement without another material.
- Native repeated-world testing found shader callback closures hid ten
  terrain textures and prop grime from ordinary material traversal. Empty
  prop buckets also left CSM-registered materials unowned. Explicit ownership
  now covers those existing resources, with actual builder/CSM tests for
  sourced swaps, preservation, suspension, resumption and final eviction.
  These tests verify disposal events, not a native memory plateau by themselves.
- The same audit identified shader-only canopy detail, off-tree grass LOD
  geometries and custom shadow materials. Vegetation now declares those
  existing resources to its owner; all thirty species configurations have
  suspension/LOD/final-eviction coverage. Engine-owned shared shadow resources
  are deliberately excluded.
- The destruction callback registry retained one props closure per visited
  map even after GPU disposal. Completed world assembly now registers its
  callbacks and returns an identity-safe disposer, invoked only at final cache
  eviction. Thirty-map coordinator tests confirm the global dispatcher inspects
  only the two resident maps; disposing an old same-ID build cannot remove its
  replacement. Temporary dormancy keeps the reusable world's bindings.
- The six-map candidate preflight retains stable textures but fails three
  strict repeat checks: managed heap on Verdant/Coastal, and one additional
  GPU geometry on Monsoon. Native diagnostic evidence at
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-client-residency-candidate6-diagnostic-r1.json`
  exhausts eligible terrain LOD jobs before capture. All GPU geometry,
  texture, program, backing-storage and embedder checks then pass. Two managed
  heap checks still fail (+1,701,048 and +1,844,868 bytes); they are not waived.
  Two native heap snapshots retain exactly two world roots and unchanged
  closure counts. Their code nodes grow 2,349,788 bytes, primarily compiled
  instruction streams; ordinary object self-size grows 31,488 bytes.
  The snapshot and CDP heap measures differ, so code is not subtracted to
  manufacture a pass. The default-protocol twenty-map retry now completes
  all sixty checkpoints in
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-client-residency-candidate20-r2.json`:
  all repeated managed/backing/embedder heap, texture and program gates pass;
  full-cycle renderer counts stay at 847 geometries, 297 textures and 216
  programs. Five per-map geometry repeat gates still fail by 1–4 geometries
  while eligible terrain LOD jobs are progressing. Delta/Badlands also retain
  one additional program versus pristine; its exact owner remains under
  investigation. The first attempt ended on a detached browser frame after
  33/60 checkpoints and remains explicitly incomplete, not a pass.
  A new acquisition protocol drains only the existing production countdown
  lookahead queue, verifies unchanged topology after real rendered frames,
  and rejects comparisons to the old wall-time protocol. Fresh matched
  pristine/candidate runs are required; no thresholds were increased.
- Alpine's final 4K image exposes repeating road-edge scallops. The old
  1.1-metre mask transition and sub-metre grass seam are narrower than the
  existing 2–4-metre mask texels. A construction-only low-pass now preserves
  the same texture dimensions and shader fetch count, and all mask channels
  sample actual pixel centres. Seventy-two quantized/bilinear bearing checks
  bound edge variation and reject alternating holes down the road centre.
  Native V12 Alpine review confirms both defects are visibly removed, with
  readable road widths/routes. An independent critic agrees; no texture-size
  increase is used.
- Whiteout's sparse vegetation declared only two archetypes, failing the
  existing three-species quality gate. Low-weight fir placements now join
  spruce and birch without increasing placement counts. Its fresh collision
  shard retains 1,449 obstacles, 1,267 colliders and 805 concealers. The narrow
  generator refresh preserves all 29 sibling shard bytes/entries exactly;
  the full index checksum is `563a5562ed5b79d1ef92500af1960ae2b7b5847330519aabd6e8a4a8d1e46c9c`.
  Final V16 public artwork includes that species correction.
- The first complete core-suite run reaches the authoritative pacing gate
  but fails with 23/120 time-limit results (the unchanged ceiling is 12.5%).
  Nine are on the new ten maps, including three on Polders and two each on
  Airfield/Whiteout. The canonical eighty-case pristine run passes exactly
  at its ceiling (10/80), versus 14/80 on the candidate's original maps.
  Initial exact-seed Polders/Airfield failure replays show kilometres of bot
  movement and ammunition exhaustion, not persistent collider wedges.
  Actual Airfield traces expose clear eye-to-eye visibility but a muzzle
  below the intervening crest. Bots now check a nominal ballistic lane at
  their existing LOS cadence and reuse relocation when blocked; sampled aim
  error and dispersion are not filtered. Three exact failed seeds now finish
  naturally, while three other inspected seeds still cap. The full canonical
  120-seed rerun now passes: median 434.8 s, p10 282.0 s, no sub-120 s
  results and 14/120 timeouts against the unchanged maximum of 15. Original
  maps have 9/80 caps; new maps have 5/40. Urban still caps in all four seeds:
  that unresolved route behavior is not hidden by relaxing exact collision.
  No pacing threshold or global vehicle/AI stat changed to hide failure.
  Independent review also found that a failed flat-cell search retried every
  simulation tick. Resetting blocked dwell before either outcome now bounds
  retries to 1.5 seconds. An actual-controller no-flat-ground regression proves
  the old 1,440-normal-query/second failure, bounded retry spacing, preserved
  ammunition and eventual relocation when suitable ground becomes available.
- The remaining core suite found missing exact loading-screen coverage for
  the ten new maps. Maps without a curated action still now use their own
  native 4K overview and canonical name. Existing owner-selected featured
  galleries/rotation stay unchanged. Loading-screen tests and the remaining
  core tail pass after the fix; the subsequent canonical pacing rerun also
  passes as recorded above.
- Caldera's exposure review identified an actual phase-lighting regression:
  disabling the Garage sun trim restored the selected workshop's preset over
  the active battlefield. Distinct Garage/battle preset ports now preserve
  each live map's sun and fill in battle, Studio and captures. Tests exercise
  different workshop/battle maps, map switches, missing world rejection and
  exact Garage return. A Garage sky override also invalidates only visible
  atmosphere state, so re-entering the same cached map restores its sky/fog
  without rebuilding the already-resident PMREM. Focused lifecycle tests and
  typecheck pass. Native V14 Caldera and Skybridge receipts confirm their
  actual CSM sun color/intensity, exposure and intended bounce fill. Caldera's
  separate authored terrain lift was also being dropped at the sourced-texture
  hookup; exact RGBA tests now cover the live swap and cache reuse. Native V15
  confirms the intended low-key volcanic grade without a larger texture or
  extra shader sample. Deep basin shadows remain deliberately dark, not a
  claim of uniform ground-level visibility.
  Independent caller review caught cold Studio requesting an absent world
  preset before loading its map. Studio now restores battlefield lighting only
  after awaited activation; a red/green actual-caller regression covers direct
  boot, first-use F8, replacement of a previous map, failed acquisition and
  Garage return. Other acquisition callers already have the correct ordering.

- The changed-file React Doctor recheck retains its earlier 49/100 score
  (62 files inspected). Exit 1 is preserved: two test-only source-extraction
  `new Function` findings and two sequential-test `await` warnings. The
  extracted text is repository-owned HUD/placement code, not user input;
  ordered world builds deliberately test eviction, and sourced-layer awaits
  keep test receipts isolated. No production eval or scanner suppression was
  introduced. Focused changed-module complexity and typecheck pass.
  The integrated release scan explicitly compares the entire branch against
  `origin/main`, rather than just its last uncommitted patch: 143 files,
  49/100, exit 1, seven errors and fifteen warnings. All findings are in
  selftests. Six errors flag execution of repository-owned source extracts;
  the camera error is on a rig stub whose caller updates the projection matrix
  immediately after `snapSniper`. Sequential awaits deliberately isolate
  lifecycle/painter fixtures. The remaining array/property warnings affect
  one-time test assertions, not render loops. No suppression or production
  change was made to improve the numeric score.
  The preceding tools-inclusive scan covers 147 files and retains 49/100, exit 1:
  seven errors and seventeen warnings. Its two added warnings are intentional
  JSON round-trip clones in the new acquisition-policy tests, which emulate
  reports read from disk and break shared fixture references before adversarial
  mutation. No new production finding is present.
  The latest V17 scan covers 150 files and retains 49/100, reporting eight
  errors and thirty-one warnings (its process exits zero despite those findings).
  All seven source-execution errors remain repository-owned selftest extracts;
  the eighth is the already-reviewed camera stub. Newly reported production
  contexts were inspected individually: roster and roof-receipt filter/map
  chains run at construction, post-pass and Studio-actor awaits deliberately
  yield for the frame budget, and the utility-pole map lookup immediately
  follows a synchronous call that creates that exact entry. The marketing
  tool's RAF positions its camera; it does not replace the renderer loop.
  No production hot-loop or security defect was confirmed from these findings.
  No rules were suppressed and no unrelated production edits were made.

### Integrated release validation (in progress)

- Release `558f0fac1` builds and typechecks successfully. The full pre group
  passes 88 test files and post passes 28. Core initially found an undocumented
  maintained codec benchmark and six intentional generated directory guides
  missing from its ownership list. The actual benchmark invocation is now
  documented and those exact guide paths registered; the hygiene test passes.
  Its next run reached the Garage architecture fixture but exceeded the
  unchanged 100 ms build ceiling (166.4 ms) during concurrent rendering and
  CPU-heavy verification. The focused quiet rerun passes both unchanged gates
  (100 ms geometry build and 750 ms cold transaction). Its scene builder and
  recipes are unchanged from the integrated parent; the concurrent failure is
  retained. The 56 already-passed core-prefix files plus this focused rerun and
  the ordered remaining tail provide explicit coverage without erasing failures.
  The ordered 320-file tail now passes to completion. Together with the prefix,
  quiet Garage rerun and added timing-acquisition test, all 378 then-registered
  core checks passed. The camera-acquisition and Delta palette increments also
  pass: current coverage is 496 files (88 pre, 380 core, 28 post). This is
  combined explicit coverage, not a claim that one uninterrupted run passed.
- The first integrated twenty-map residency run has 60 valid double-GC
  samples, 58 actual evictions, zero browser/resource errors, and stable repeat
  geometry, texture, shader-program, backing-store and embedder counts. Its
  strict repeat managed-heap gate fails on Verdant, Desert and Winter by
  recording roughly 1.8–2.0 MB growth. This remains a failure pending diagnosis.
- Cross-revision scene comparison additionally exposed an acquisition error:
  the old capture hardcodes M1A2, while current captures preserve the selected
  vehicle and a fresh profile defaults to M1A3. Shader-owner evidence confirms
  that identical unique vehicle-ID sets did not prove identical lineups.
  Prior reports remain diagnostic; fresh comparisons must pin selection and
  exact roster and verify ordered actual entity/spec/team/player identities.
  A clean baseline at the integrated parent `2c22d203d` also isolates these
  environment changes from unrelated upstream vehicle changes.
- Fresh integrated canonical pacing passes all 120 runs: median 434.8 s,
  tenth percentile 282.0 s, zero sub-120-second battles and 14 timeouts under
  the unchanged maximum of 15. Results match the pre-integration run; Urban's
  four timeouts in four tested seeds remain an explicit pacing limitation.
  The all-thirty-map authoritative bot check also passes (72/144 moving hits).
- Final V16 artwork exports all thirty native 3840×2160 sources at render
  scale 1 and dynamic scale 1, with each actual CSM sun matching its authored
  map preset. Thirty 4K WebP heroes total 37,866,322 bytes, thirty 512×288
  thumbnails total 920,468 bytes, and thirty refreshed native-scene minimaps
  total 1,704,902 bytes. Loading-screen and map-art guards pass. The final
  production build succeeds with these assets. Evidence is in
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-release-final4k-v16/` and the sibling capture,
  artwork and minimap V16 logs.
  Three native-image reviews cover every map. No blocking open seams,
  airborne scenery or disconnected roads/water were identified in these
  views. Alpine's road-edge voids and Skybridge's wet rail veneers are absent;
  Caldera retains distinguishable routes under its deliberately dark grade.
  Distant conical peaks, simplified cliff/tree LODs and occasional small
  contour steps remain stylistic limitations. These stills do not establish
  photoreal parity, panning stability or physical iPad Safari performance.
- The earlier fixed-camera timing acquisition used schema-3 reports from one identical harness:
  pinned roster, bounded texture readiness, baseline camera applied before
  sampling, verified production terrain lookahead and native/untrimmed render
  settings checked before and after every repeat. Paired runs are timing-only;
  image tours cannot change scene history between compared samples. Earlier
  mixed-history reports remain diagnostic, including their failed metrics.
  The existing timing tolerances are unchanged; fresh paired timing is open.
  The completed ninety-file artwork set is checkpointed locally as
  `5b1cabc0b`; no environment commit has been pushed yet.
- The schema-3 three-map acquisition smoke (Verdant, Delta, Badlands) passes
  its live camera/roster/readiness/render-state checks without browser errors.
  Its thirty-frame, single-repeat timing is not release certification. The
  strict resource gate correctly failed Delta: one incidental farmhouse paint
  family added one attached material and three uploaded textures. Reusing
  Delta's existing second plaster family now matches the baseline's 34 scene
  materials and 43 textures. The actual production-builder regression proves
  unchanged geometry/UV bytes, collision receipts and random stream. V17 native
  4K review confirms the farmhouse retains its surface detail; its three public
  images are refreshed (the minimap remains byte-identical).
  Updated public totals are 37,865,706 bytes for the thirty heroes, 920,318
  bytes for their thumbnails and 1,704,902 bytes for the thirty minimaps.
  This is not a timing pass: the V17 smoke records 85–104 ms frame medians on
  all three maps, versus 20–22 ms previously, and three extra renderer programs
  even on Verdant where world geometry, draw counts and triangles are unchanged.
  Read-only process inspection found concurrent external browser and fleet-test
  workloads; they were left untouched. The global retained-owner difference
  still requires diagnosis, and these failed measurements remain preserved.
  Source inspection identifies an uncontrolled pre-map owner: optional Garage
  dressing can finish during the capture's fleet/FX imports while the phase is
  still Garage. The slow V17 run retains 173 more geometries and ten more
  textures than the preceding candidate even though its Verdant world subtree
  is identical. A workshop-core census is consistent with that difference,
  but the old reports cannot prove the exact owner of every extra resource.
  Final timing acquisition will wait for the normal complete Garage build and
  warm one fixed Garage view in both roots before the first battlefield;
  fixed-camera memory acquisition remains unchanged.
  A final independent harness review found that this timing tool always used
  Vite development serving: an unrecognized `--production` was ignored. The
  preceding smoke reports are development-server evidence, not production
  measurements. Schema 5 (`settled-pinned-map-timing-v3`) now selects actual
  Vite preview serving for production, records each build-index SHA, rejects
  mixed build modes and changed build artifacts, and preserves startup/cleanup
  failures. Regression tests execute both server-selection/cleanup branches
  and adversarial provenance cases. The frozen combined harness SHA is
  `0cd84aa58fd0b325ffc0ee93544cf4063390046e337377588d4dd9fbbefefca4`.
  The production pair is explicitly 180 submitted frames per repeat, five
  repeats per map, 2,500 ms settle and 1440×900/DPR 1, with identical complete
  Garage ownership and eight pre-map rendered warmup frames. Neither paired
  run has started yet; unrelated active host workloads remain outside this
  task's control and must be disclosed with the timing results.
- Residency acquisition now separately uses schema 3 with one immutable
  absolute-camera manifest on both roots. The preceding pinned-roster run
  exposed terrain-relative camera differences on eight maps, so it is not a
  matched-view comparison. Raw evidence and failed gates remain preserved.
  The fixed-manifest run verifies exact pose, FOV, clipping planes, actual
  render settings and finite production terrain topology. Synthetic camera
  zoom/view-offset changes are outside this receipt contract: neither tested
  battlefield path sets those properties, and viewport-driven aspect is
  unchanged. This is a bounded current-source invariant, not a general claim
  to detect every possible future projection mutation.
  The pristine integrated-parent fixed-camera baseline is complete at
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-client-residency-origin20-pinned-v3.json`:
  60 valid checkpoints, 58 actual evictions, zero browser/resource errors and
  1,314 passing acquisition checks. Its 80 boundedness failures are preserved.
  At the final Skybridge checkpoint each cycle, uploaded textures rise
  541 → 801 → 1,061 and backing storage rises 2,008.9 → 3,930.0 → 5,851.6 MB.
  The updated production build succeeds with Delta's fix; its fixed-camera
  candidate comparison is the remaining memory gate, not another baseline run.
  That candidate comparison has now completed all 60 checkpoints with valid
  evidence and zero browser/resource errors. All repeat GPU counts, backing
  storage and embedder-memory checks pass. Six strict failures remain: Verdant
  and Winter managed heap grows by 1,981,596 and 1,989,708 bytes, respectively,
  beyond their unchanged 1%/1 MiB limits; the two-map cache retains one extra
  geometry while Monsoon is resident (Monsoon and the following Alpine in both
  measured cycles). This is not release approval. The exact report is
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-client-residency-release20-pinned-v3.json`.
  The separate, explicitly instrumented current-build run completed all 60
  checkpoints with zero browser/resource errors. Its only local gate failure
  is Winter managed heap (+1,786,292 bytes against a 1,567,902-byte limit).
  Four native heap snapshots cover the same Verdant/Winter checkpoints in
  the two measured cycles. Weak-reference geometry ownership records 47
  vegetation, 60 prop and 53 uploaded terrain geometries for Monsoon; without
  a paired baseline inventory this does not identify the extra upload's owner.
  The diagnostic report is
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-client-residency-release20-heap-v17-d1.json`;
  native heap-class/retainer analysis is now complete. This run does not
  overwrite or compare against the default run, change tolerances, or add
  warmup cycles. Browser and preview cleanup completed before offline parsing.
  Winter's native snapshot code self-size rises 1,547,712 bytes, versus
  35,912 bytes for ordinary objects; Verdant's code rises 849,344 bytes and
  ordinary objects 38,500 bytes. These are class self-size deltas, not retained
  sizes, and do not waive or subtract from the failed managed-heap gate.
  The scalar analysis is
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-residency-release20-heap-v17-d1-summary.json`.
  A separate native retainer trace finds real full-scene CPU retention:
  `props.ts`'s shared baked-geometry cache keeps a geometry key alive, and
  `lighting.ts`'s `_geomClaims` weak-key map strongly retains its first mesh.
  That mesh's parent links retain discarded Verdant and Caldera trees (256
  and 233 scene objects respectively), not merely empty scene shells. The
  exact incoming-edge evidence is
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-residency-release20-heap-v17-d1-world-shells.json`.
  The correction now stores weak mesh ownership and a non-owning, permanent
  shared-geometry sentinel. A native forced-GC regression executes the actual
  production culling block with real Three.js meshes. It proves collection
  of the mesh, props parent and full world while shared geometry stays cached;
  same-owner claim reuse; safe expired-owner replacement; and permanent
  invalidation of all owners when geometry is shared. Real culling compacts
  three instances to one, then restores matrix/color/geometry-level attribute
  bytes exactly. Eight subsequent shadow frames per shared owner leave counts
  and bytes unchanged. Existing shadow fit/refresh/stability, resource lifetime,
  phase GPU residency and world-coordinator tests pass, as do typecheck and
  lighting complexity limits. The registered suite now contains 497 files.
  The V18 production rebuild passes; rebuilt browser eviction measurements
  are still required. Its build-index SHA is
  `745ba3925f44f2348ca872d6c40d05834352d2f863740586642ea09c371335b9`.
  The required changed-scope React Doctor scan remains 49/100 (151 files),
  the same score as the preceding scan; no lighting finding is reported.
  Existing test-extraction diagnostics are retained, not suppressed.
- A bounded paired production diagnostic now covers Badlands → Monsoon →
  Alpine over three sweeps in both roots. All eighteen acquisition checkpoints
  are valid, with zero browser/resource errors. Monsoon has 59 → 60 uploaded
  prop geometries in every sweep, while vegetation stays at 47 and uploaded
  terrain at 53. Prop attribute/index storage falls 34,760,072 → 33,408,120
  bytes. Source/signature reconciliation identifies two added intact pools:
  `drumred` (330 vertices) and a second sedan/wagon body (2,724 vertices), with
  one earlier anonymous 216-vertex geometry absent. The six final merged
  material buckets remain six, and the car shapes are genuinely different;
  no trivial redundant material split has been established. The additional
  pool types require independent destruction slots. Fewer bytes alone do not
  waive the independent geometry-count failure.
  A bounded consolidation audit hashes all 84 intact/broken kit builders at
  three fixed RNG inputs, including attributes, indices and groups: no
  cross-kind intact geometry is identical. Duplicate broken-vehicle builder
  formulas consume the shared RNG at different positions and start hidden,
  so sharing them would neither preserve debris nor offset this upload.
  Packed models are distinct, identical model/options requests already share
  geometry, and static wrecks intentionally differ in shadow behavior from
  the ordinary baked bucket. No safe small consolidation was established.
  Both reports retain their local failures: the original has nine repeated
  texture/heap/backing-store failures; the candidate has one Badlands heap
  failure (+1,599,772 bytes against a 1,418,149-byte limit). Reports are
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-monsoon-owner-origin-v1.json` and
  `/private/tmp/cot-environment-monsoon-owner-release-v1.json`. Both owned
  browser/preview sessions are closed before offline analysis.

## Integration notes

- All thirty IDs are present in canonical catalogs, random battle, private
  room selection, ranked rotation, shot views, and lightweight preview metadata.
- New industrial/dry settings reuse existing clutter palettes and budgets.
- Alpha deployment faces the opposing deployment centroid, not whichever
  enemy pad happens to be array element zero. The authority regression checks
  this independently and verifies that pad ordering does not change yaw.
- Server manifests are generated into `server/world-collision-manifests/`.
  Loaders verify byte length, checksum, shape and census before inflation.
  Active matches share immutable terrain but keep mutable collision records
  separate; removal, expiry, close and constructor failure release leases.
- Final thirty-map export verifies all ordered IDs, checksums, bytes and
  census: 132,035 obstacles, 131,999 colliders and
  119,022 concealers. Original-map serialized shapes are larger than the
  retained legacy file because that file predates the inherited runtime
  structure-profile change (`cea661b54` / `34ca7d133`). For example, Urban's
  unchanged 2,300 structure records contain 32,538 convex parts rather than
  7,755. This stale file is not a matched environment-cost baseline; the
  regenerated data intentionally matches current runtime collision geometry.
- An exact primitive dictionary reduces the thirty-map shards from 47,861,896
  to 36,937,165 bytes without changing points, precision or collider behavior
  (36,937,163 after the two-byte Whiteout species refresh).
  All thirty decode round trips match, malformed references are rejected and
  mutable match shapes remain independent. Six balanced pairs of fresh Node
  processes measure cold-loader median 296.45 → 278.45 ms (OS file caches not
  flushed), and retained fixture heap 7,420,884 → 6,154,800 bytes. The receipt
  is `/private/tmp/cot-collision-codec-benchmark-final.json`.
- The legacy 27,572,252-byte monolithic manifest was removed after the final
  thirty-map loader/collision/lifecycle checks passed. It remains recoverable
  from Git. The retired `--migrate` option now fails before browser access or
  publishing; future captures write the current per-map encoding.
- All thirty minimaps were regenerated successfully from current native
  scene captures. The bake now participates in the shared capture lock and
  validates the exposed active world and exact fresh capture receipt.
  All thirty native-4K hero sources, 4K WebP heroes and 512×288 thumbnails
  were generated and visually reviewed. The cache tag is `north-up-v6`.
  V16 replaces all public images after the final road-mask/configuration/
  phase-lighting corrections. Its all-map production refresh and independent
  native-image review are complete, with limitations recorded above.
