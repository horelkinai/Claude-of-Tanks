# The Geometry Gate

Current source-backed new builds use the **92-point exemplar** contract in
[vehicle instructions](../src/vehicles/SKILL.md), not the legacy 90 floor stated
in the historical program below. See the
[tank-generation handbook](tank-generation/README.md) for source-only frame
freezing, owner-selected supplied-file targets, current tool availability and
handoff procedure. Older axis-warp/cap recipes are historical, not permission
to fit a new source oracle to its candidate. Preserve raw dimension and other
gate conflicts; an explicit as-is publication never changes a failed score.

The authoritative, ruthless scoring mechanism for the from-scratch rebuild
program. A tank ships only when it passes **BOTH** gates:

1. **Geometric gate** — `node tools/geometry-gate.mjs --ids=<id>` reports
   **every component ≥ 90** (the minimum is the headline; nothing averages
   away a failure).
2. **Visual gate** — the independent shaded-parity critic scores the tank
   ≥ 9.0/10 on every view of its board (`&board=1`), i.e. "same vehicle,
   same tier" against the reference render.

IoU (`npm run model:fidelity`) remains a regression floor, not a pass bar.

## What the geometric gate measures

Run per tank: `tools/procedural-fidelity.html?id=<id>&geo=1`, driven by
`tools/geometry-gate.mjs`. Both models — reference GLB and procedural build —
go through the **identical** measurement pipeline (1024-px ortho masks →
column polylines). Nothing is self-reported; the procedural build can only
score by actually matching the measured reference geometry.

### Components (all must be ≥ 90)

| Component | What it is |
|---|---|
| `hullCurves` | min of side/plan/front hull-only silhouette curve scores |
| `wholeCurves` | min of side/plan/front whole-vehicle curve scores |
| `turretCurves` | min of side/plan turret-only (mask below `rig_turret`) curve scores, trimmed to each model's hull footprint ±0.6 m — barrels leave the turret comparison (they belong to wholeCurves + overallLengthM) while bustles and mantlets stay; vacuous 100 for `fixedMount` casemates (spec-driven — an emptied rig cannot fake it) |
| `stations` | 14 hull cross-sections: width + roof-height error, trimmed mean |
| `dims` | published real-vehicle dimensions vs the procedural build |
| `floaters` | disconnected-geometry islands across 5 articulation poses |

### Curve scoring

Each curve is ~90 columns of `[along, top, bottom]` in metres, traced from
the mask. Registration is translation-only (span midpoint along the axis,
mean-Δy vertical) — rotation/scale are NOT compensated, so a mis-scaled or
listing build fails. The registration is computed ONCE per view from the
**hull curves** (the hull mask contains no barrel, so gun-length deltas
cannot shift the frame — building the published-length gun against a
short-barrelled oracle stays satisfiable) and **reused** for that view's
whole and turret rows: a turret 40 cm out of position (or floating high)
cannot self-register the error away. Coverage counts BOTH directions —
reference columns the build misses AND build columns the reference lacks —
so excess geometry is as visible as missing geometry. Errors are per-column
band-edge deviations, normalised by the reference's governing dimension
(height for side/front, length for plan):

```
score = 100 − 12·meanPct − 0.6·p95Pct − 1.5·coverPct
```

- `meanPct` — mean per-column error. The dominant term: 90 requires the
  build to track the reference within ≈0.6% (≈2 cm on a 3.3 m tank).
- `p95Pct` — 95th-percentile error. Catches systematic regional misses
  without letting one aliased column own the score (raw max was gamed by
  noise, p95 cannot be gamed by hiding a bad region under 5% of columns
  wider than one feature).
- `coverPct` — columns where only one model has geometry (overhang/length
  mismatch), with a margin of 0.75 column-pitch so sub-pixel edge jitter
  never counts as missing volume.

Every curve row in the report carries `worst`: the 12 worst columns with
`at / refTop / refBot / procTop / procBot / errM` — the exact work order
("at z=+4.36 your bow bottom is 0.58 m too deep").

### Stations

14 slices along each model's own hull **z-range measured from its side
hull mask** (gun-invariant — a long barrel cannot skew the slice positions
onto empty air), comparing width% and roof-height% (relative to height).
Trimmed mean (2 worst slices dropped — a bustle overhang must not mask
everything else, but systematic width error still fails):
`100 − 10·trimW − 10·trimTop`.

**Plate fill rule (owner directive 2026-08-01, KV-2 example):** any
plate, shelf, lip, or strip added for silhouette/shading parity must
read as SOLID FABRICATION at close-up — no hollow backs, no floating
single-sided panels, no visible void between the plate and the parent
surface. Close the volume (back face + end caps) or extend it to hull
contact; webs/gussets are encouraged where a real vehicle would have
them. Fills must stay WITHIN the certified silhouette (gate scores
must not move); graduates re-run the gate and re-freeze their geometry
hash after any fill. The turntable close-up review checks for this
explicitly.

**Station-slice visibility (edge-on prism law, russia r7c):** the
station cameras render a ~0.52 m near/far-clipped z-slab, so an
axis-aligned long thin box presents ONLY its end caps to the front
camera — its side/top faces project to zero width and the part is
invisible at every mid-span slice. Any gate-facing thin/long kit
(sidewall strips, full-length fender prisms, rails) authored as a
single axis-aligned prism will silently depress `stations` width rows
even though the silhouette views see it fine. Author such kit
segmented (per-bin boxes with real end faces, like actual stowage) or
give it front-facing geometry. This is a build defect pattern, not a
measurement artifact — the pipeline measures correctly (probe:
`tools/tmp-r7ru-stations.mjs` precedent, t62mv1 stations 54.2 → 76.1
from segmentation alone).

### Dims — the published-spec anchor

Measured **from the procedural build's curves** against `spec.dims`
(published real-vehicle data): `heightM` and `hullLengthM` from the side
body extent (columns with band > 12% of height, so gun barrels don't count;
roof = p95 of column tops, so a 2-column antenna mast doesn't define the
height), `overallLengthM` from the full side span (gun included), `widthM`
at PIXEL resolution from the plan mask (trace columns quantize to ~11 cm
when a long gun pins the frame; lit-pixel extent resolves ~2-3 cm) over
pixel columns with > 0.35 m of band — skirts and fenders count toward
width (published widths include them); whip antennas don't. Score:
`100 − Σ max(0, pct − 1)·8` — 1% grace per dim, then 8 points per percent.

This is the anti-gaming anchor: a build that "matches" a defective oracle
(sunken hull, sky-high fused turret) still fails dims, and a build that
matches dims but not the curves fails the curves. You cannot satisfy both
without being actually right.

### Floaters

Articulation poses (turret 0/90/180, gun full depression/elevation), 2-pass
dilated mask, any disconnected island > 400 px in any pose = fail. Turrets
that leave their baskets, guns that separate from mantlets.

## The loop

```
node tools/geometry-gate.mjs --ids=<family ids>
  → docs/geometry-gate/<id>.json   (scores + per-column work orders)
  → docs/geometry-gate/ledger.json (tool-written only, never by hand)
```

1. Builder reads its family's JSONs, fixes the worst component using the
   `worst` columns and station/dim rows as the work order.
2. Re-run the gate. Repeat until every component ≥ 90. There is no
   iteration cap — the gate defines done.
3. Then the visual gate: regenerate boards, independent critic scores
   shaded parity ≥ 9.0/10 per view. Geometry ≥ 90 with a failed critic
   means readability/material work, not silhouette work — fix and re-run
   BOTH (any geometry edit invalidates the previous critic verdict).
4. Family commit only when both gates pass (or a defect cap is certified).

### Top-down fill & circularity review (owner directive 2026-08-02)

Every turntable/board review — agent self-review and orchestrator landing
review alike — now includes a SHADED top-down pass plus a tilted top-down
perspective view (not just the orthographic top mask):

- **Fill check**: the tank must not read "empty" from above. Decks, roofs,
  sponsons, bins and racks must be closed volumes — no interior voids, no
  see-through shells, no unclosed geometry visible from overhead. This is
  the overhead companion to the plate-fill law: orthographic silhouettes
  cannot see hollowness; a top-down shaded view can.
- **Circularity check**: the top view is where circular geometry is
  judged — turret ring, hatch rings, cupolas, wheel/drum cross-sections,
  and gun-tube sections must read as true circles/cylinders at the
  print's own tier (no coarse faceting, no broken arcs, no polygon reads
  where the reference is round).
- **Depth & perspective**: reviews must include perspective views and
  reason about depth cues, not only orthographic silhouettes — hollow
  backs, floating panels and open shells hide in orthos and reveal under
  perspective.

### Certified oracle-defect caps

Some references are physically defective (fused rigs, yawed bodies,
short-modelled barrels — see `tools/repair_oracles*.py`). If a component is
provably capped by an oracle defect: document the cap in
`docs/references/tanks/<id>.md`, repair the oracle if a rigid transform can
(batch queue), and the build must then match **published dims + the
undamaged views**. A cap certification never excuses `dims`. Because
registration is hull-anchored, a short-barrelled oracle caps ONLY
`wholeCurves` (via the symmetric-coverage penalty on the build's correct,
longer gun) — hull, turret, stations and dims all remain fully satisfiable,
and a cap claiming more than wholeCurves on such an oracle is invalid.

The dual defect — a fused tube authored provably LONG (beyond the
published overall length, e.g. m46's reused m26 tube at +6.6%) — caps
`wholeCurves` AND exactly those `turretCurves` plan columns the tube
itself occupies (the plan trim is lateral, so a fused tube's forward
extent stays inside the trimmed centre columns; the capped columns must
be listed per-column in the tank's packet). Hull, stations and dims
remain fully satisfiable, and side-view turret rows are NOT covered by
this cap.

Graduated tanks (dual-gate passes whose in-game GLB registration has
been retired) remain measurement-bound: their reference files stay on
disk as oracles, and until the harness grows a graduate-reference
override, freeze verification is by geometry-hash invariance of the
procedural build (`tools/tmp-hashgeo.mjs`) — a gate run against a
missing reference writes a false 0 row and must not be recorded in the
ledger.

### Orientation truth (v11, owner bug 2026-08-01)

Translation-only registration is blind to a fore-aft mirrored build:
t62mv1 shipped with its hull backwards and turret seated at the stern
while scoring ~70 — the bulk silhouette still overlapped. v11 adds a
mirror check (side+plan hull curves re-scored with the proc curve
mirrored about its span midpoint; a decisively better mirror fit
hard-zeros the row with `orientationFlip: true`). LIMITATION, learned
from the same tank: near-symmetric silhouettes (T-62 class low wedges)
evade the mirror check — the backwardness lives in shaded features the
masks cannot see. Orientation truth therefore has three layers, all
required: (1) builder-side vertex asserts — bow direction and turret
seat derived from the reference vertices (gun-forward at yaw 0 = +z)
must match the build, and the turret's underside must not penetrate
the hull deck beyond the ring recess; (2) the v11 mirror check for
asymmetric hulls; (3) a MANDATORY human/critic turntable review before
any sheet ships or any landing is reported — curve scores alone never
certify a tank again.

### Anti-gaming rules

- Both models are measured by the same pipeline; builders never hand the
  gate numbers.
- `min()` everywhere — no averaging across views, components, or tanks.
- Published dims anchor the scale; width normalisation in the game loader
  means exceeding the committed max width silently rescales the whole tank
  (WIDTH GUARD comments in the profile files).
- The ledger is tool-written; hand edits are a program violation.
- Reference-model usage (OWNER RULING 2026-08-01, supersedes the earlier
  measurement-only rule): the actual geometry of the community reference
  models may be analyzed directly — vertices, corners, cross-sections —
  and used as the basis for alignment and for the procedural builds
  themselves, scaled 100% to published real-vehicle sizes. This unlocks
  two techniques: (1) **vertex-space oracle normalization** — repair
  recipes may rescale/warp a stylized print axis-wise to published dims
  (per-axis factors documented in the packet, append-only recipes,
  pristine .bak, byte-idempotent) so its curve rows measure the real
  vehicle; (2) **vertex-informed building** — builders may derive
  profile curves, station targets, and corner positions from the
  (normalized) reference vertices instead of only from rendered masks.
  Published dims stay sovereign and the gate's measurement pipeline is
  unchanged — a vertex-informed build still passes only by matching the
  measured reference through the same mask pipeline. Provenance stays in
  the packet + docs/ATTRIBUTION.md. The ONE absolute rule is untouched:
  assets extracted from commercial games are forbidden, always.

## Current baseline

### Historical first-party preservation (2026-09-04)

A deliberately preserved historical first-party design is not a source-fidelity
rebuild. The sole current allowlisted case, `leo2_revolution_proto`, compares
against a hash-pinned export of the original authored `leo2_revolution` at
commit `da5e0cf0af4e4ddf7a29ec78d7e1c120ce12755b`. Its report must say
`comparisonPurpose: preservation`, never imply real-world accuracy, and carry
the original commit and verified baseline hash. See the exact export and
provenance procedure in [the Revolution source packet](research/leopard-revolution-source.md).

This preservation mode is stricter about change: **every view and component
must reach 99**. It does not independently normalize either model's scale or
origin. Dimensions compare actual baseline and candidate masks through the
same cameras, preserving known historical inaccuracies without labeling them
accurate. The frozen bytes must match their committed SHA-256 before loading;
a candidate export cannot substitute for the historical oracle. The rebuilt
`leo2_revolution` remains a separate source-fidelity comparison at the **92**
exemplar floor, with published-dimension checks unchanged. No other vehicle
can opt into preservation without an explicit audited historical baseline.

See `docs/geometry-gate/ledger.json`. At gate freeze the fleet's best tank
(m60a1) scores min 40 — the gate is deliberately far ahead of the fleet.
That is the point: it is the definition of done, not a description of today.

## Owner directives 2026-08-02 (evening) — three new visual laws

1. **M1 FRONT SLOPE (abrams family).** The M1's upper front plate is NOT
   flat-vertical — it is one of the most raked glacis plates ever
   fielded. Any abrams-family build whose front reads as a flat/blocky
   face fails the visual gate regardless of curve scores. Verify the
   slope reads in the garage/perspective renders, not just orthos.

2. **NO EMPTY AREAS / TURRET CONTIGUITY (fleet-wide).** Tanks must not
   render with hollow pockets, gaps between shapes, or see-through
   voids (owner example: leo2a6 turret side/rear showed dark empty
   areas between masses). Turrets are CONTIGUOUS volumes for the most
   part — no "shaping for the sake of shaping": every standoff mass
   must read as attached (mounts, brackets, contact shadows), not
   floating with air behind it. This extends the top-down fill law to
   ALL angles, garage/perspective included.

3. **DECORATION MINIMUM (fleet-wide, gate-blocking).** A tank is NOT
   READY while any large surface reads totally flat. Roof MACHINE GUNS
   are MANDATORY (multiple allowed and encouraged) — even where the
   reference lacks one, add a tastefully-integrated pintle MG; critics
   must not penalize that as a parity deviation. Beyond MGs, dress flat
   areas from this class list: lights, ropes/tow cables, ladders,
   ERA/generic armor blocks, wooden trunks, canisters, bags, smoke
   launchers, railings and holders. Decoration is part of "done", not
   garnish.

4. **TRACK CONTAINMENT (fleet-wide, 2026-08-03).** Tracks must not clip
   through the front or rear of the tank (owner garage screenshot: track
   shoes piercing the bow plate/fender on the turntable). The track
   loop's wrap arcs — band, shoes, guide horns — must stay CLEAR of hull
   solids (bow/stern plates, fenders, mud flaps): either the plate sits
   proud of the wrap with real clearance, or the wrap is genuinely open
   to air. Audit tool: `tools/track-clip-audit.mjs` (--exact for true
   interpenetration; default adds a 2cm near-contact margin) (voxel overlap between
   the band meshes and center-reaching hull solids in the front/rear
   wrap zones; offenders in shots/track-clip.json). Builders self-check
   bow/stern close views on every round that moves nose/tail geometry
   or wheel positions; critics add a TRACK-CONTAINMENT check to front/
   rear/hero views.
   A source-authored fender/skirt enclosure may be factory-tagged
   `trackGuard` and excluded from hull candidates only when the game's native
   track visibly runs behind it. This exemption never applies to donor track,
   wheels/end drums, bow/stern structure, or generic trim. The required
   visual proof is one native station set and one continuous shoe course,
   without duplicate running gear, guard penetration, collapsed wrap arcs,
   or an air gap.

Enforcement: critics add four checks to every verdict — FRONT-SLOPE
(abrams only), CONTIGUITY (all angles), DECORATION MINIMUM (roof MGs
present? flat areas dressed?), TRACK-CONTAINMENT (bow/stern wraps clear
of hull solids). Builders treat missing MGs as a work-order item of the
same rank as a failed view. Graduates are not exempt: leo2a6 is flagged
for a contiguity fix round (leopard lane, after kf51 r7); the m1a1-line
graduates queue for a front-slope + decoration audit.


## §10 amendment (2026-08-03, isu152 re-cert finding)
Graduation retires the registration into THREE override maps, not two:
`tools/procedural-fidelity.html` LOCAL_REFERENCE_OVERRIDES,
`tools/tmp-tank-critic.html` CRITIC_REFERENCE_OVERRIDES (local tmp), AND
`tools/visual-evaluator-page.html` CRITIC_REFERENCE_OVERRIDES (committed —
the §D evaluator aborts on graduates without it). Also: evaluator evidence
dirs are per-run — archive shots/visual-eval-<id>/ before re-runs when the
prior round's evidence matters.

## Amendment (2026-08-05): trim-boundary interp clamp
The curve scorer's resampler declared a ±0.02 in-span tolerance past the
end columns but could not extrapolate there — every sample in that band
nulled into fake cover (the centurion push-2 find: dAlong at half-pitch
parity paired the ref gun's last trim-window columns 1-4mm past the last
proc column; ~2.9 pts of phantom turret_side cover). interp() now clamps
to the edge column INSIDE the already-declared tolerance; beyond it
stays null. Fleet A/B at the change: centurion5 87.2 -> 90.5 PASS,
centurion3 87.7 -> 91.1 PASS (the priced artifact released exactly);
graduates m47 90.5 -> 91.0, merkava3d 90.2 -> 90.4, t84/leo2a5
bit-identical — held-or-up across the board, no regression possible by
construction (lenient only where the span check already said in-span).
Frozen graduate rows that drift UP from this amendment refresh in the
ledger without re-certification (scores changed, builds did not).

## §10 amendment (2026-08-05): mirror the HELPER-EXPANDED config
When retiring a registration into the three override maps, mirror the
FULLY-EXPANDED runtime config, never the surface call site: userdrops
helpers inject fields (the `articulated` helper includes `gunNode:'^Gun'`)
and dropping one cratered a graduate to min 0 at load-prove (the leo2a5
gunNode incident). Dump the runtime truth with tools/tmp-modelsource-dump
(full-chain import required for donor order) and mirror THAT.
