# Wreck and multiplayer delivery closeout

This closes the outstanding implementation work from the wreck/loading thread.
It does not relabel historical performance observations as proof of zero
latency or a universally fixed frame budget.

## Already delivered before this integration

The following changes are ancestors of the integration base `d0d01a903`:

| Requested behavior | Maintained implementation history |
| --- | --- |
| Redis-free private rooms and LAN, failure handling and cleanup | Cloudflare signaling `e60d2839a`; private-room acquisition `ce9941ff7`; responsiveness hardening `10ac577de` |
| Movement reconciliation without the reproduced suspension wobble | `72d46c8f8`; see `multiplayer-moving-jitter-2026-09.md` |
| Normal bot turret and gun aiming | `bdee8b423` |
| Ready can be reversed to Not Ready | `bcd0946a5` |
| Joined-room preparation, covered failure recovery and nonblack reveal | `6dbc1de07`, `7c444d80d` |
| Concurrent roster/world acquisition and shader preparation | `fcbcc961a`, `92d55cdbd`, `c5ca781e2` |
| Full five-second countdown, not simulation-slowed countdown | `cd7939351` |
| Version displayed and derived from each build revision | `bc9670667` |
| Ammo depletion and independent shell/missile selection | `846826e73`, `519de9de5`, `c63f136c8` |
| Shared vehicle muzzle seating, Browning-family weapons and camouflage fixes | `133cef6b3`, `e70dafdfd`, `445d2e4bf`, `d1f451df2`, `f19b47d2e` |

These are implementation/ancestry references, not new certification of every
old vehicle annotation or every possible runtime/network condition.

## Remaining implementation delivered by this integration

- Expand the contemporary wreck pool from 14 to 32 public playable donors;
  use explicit casts across all 30 maps and replace retired Leopard 2A7 with
  public Leopard 2A7V. All era pools together contain 51 unique donors.
- Keep existing char/rust, destroyed poses and debris, while admitting the
  additional light, missile, infantry-fighting and main-battle silhouettes.
  Preserve desktop/mobile placement caps and only advance an authored donor
  after successful placement. Refresh the canonical collision receipts.
- Move asynchronous wreck baking to an owned module worker, transfer only
  retained geometry, acquire only selected families, and drain cancellation,
  startup, timeout, transfer and partial-hydration failures.
- Avoid discarded factory paint and duplicate wreck paint work without
  changing the final visible geometry/paint. Keep the synchronous path usable.
- Prepare sourced terrain before fallback painting, pace overdue loading
  frames, batch wall fits and first shadow work, and avoid full shell-profile
  derivation when a non-building pool needs only its contact band.
- Deduplicate repeated progress DOM writes and restart countdown motion
  without forced layout. Preserve the existing fade/covered-reveal lifecycle.
- Keep every profiler metric enforced after the optimized compaction path;
  instrument the shared compaction body, not iterator creation.

The source checkpoint is `835b1d3c9`; the three-way integration starts at
`3b0844f48`. It preserves incoming HUD/layout, Verdant horizon, night-fixture
and test-registry changes. No shared dirty checkout, temporary QA output,
credentials, or unrelated vehicle bodywork is included.

## Evidence and limits

Detailed retained evidence lives in `wreck-roster-expansion-2026-09.md` and
`multiplayer-loading-paint-dedup-2026-09.md`. The pre-integration frozen native
two-client test passed complete 5/4/3/2/1, nonblack reveal, advancing battle,
Garage return and cleanup. Preparation measured 3,139/3,312 ms; sampled
post-reveal frame gaps reached 35.4/38.5 ms, while covered loading reached
132.4/129.3 ms. These are measured limits, not stall-free claims.

The original 214–319 ms gaps lack the contemporaneous trace needed to assign
an exact cause. Browser/OS background-host throttling and real network latency
cannot be eliminated by this client patch. Same-machine relay/impairment/room
scale tests are not physical-device or distant-network certification.

Integrated test, build, native and landing results are recorded below when
they actually complete; retained evidence above is not substituted for them.

### Integrated verification, September 9 UTC

- Typecheck/core-unused and the public production build passed on the
  integration candidate.
- All **46** selected tests passed: every changed selftest (30), plus 16
  dependent world/terrain/shadow/network/registry tests. This includes actual
  headless bakes of the complete admitted wreck roster, paint/topology parity,
  worker cancellation/transfer/error ownership, all-map casts and collision
  receipts, wall batching, loading UI and room-entry lifecycles.
- One `npm test` lifecycle was started, then deliberately interrupted while
  its pre suite was passing: it duplicated the release task's unrelated fleet
  validation. Its exit was 143. It is **not** reported as a complete suite pass.
  The explicit diff-complete selection used the normal shared FIFO runner.
- A fresh immutable public-build native two-client check passed. Both peers
  showed the complete foreground 5/4/3/2/1 sequence, nonblack reveal without
  rescue, advancing battle, native Garage return and room closure. There were
  zero application exceptions, renderer crashes or dropped observations.
  All rooms, browser, preview, signaling and capture lease were released.
- That native check observed 4,689/4,824 ms preparation (host/guest), and
  4,881/4,874 ms from the first observed 5 to rollout. Largest observed rAF
  gaps across loading/countdown were 191.4/152.5 ms. These remain explicit
  limits; this sample is not a controlled speedup or zero-lag certification.
- The frozen build content SHA-256 was
  `45f33618331abf8513e3b284dc7a6780f9e4eba0e49d7d7be51da1a8fd04d4d0`;
  build/acquisition identity stayed unchanged. Its version was
  `v1.0.0+g3b0844f48.dirty` because observer/fixture-only integration edits were
  pending at build time. The later commit does not claim different native
  measurements.
- After that check, main added an independent Verdant horizon restoration.
  The candidate rebased cleanly onto `7b91b838b`; the only Verdant runtime delta
  from that new base is the authored wreck cast. The native scenario was
  Winter, not a validation of the newly restored Verdant horizon.
- The final rebased tree passed typecheck/core-unused, the public production
  build, and six overlap checks: map quality, wreck roster, Verdant horizon,
  horizon resources, all 30 dedicated collision manifests, and the complete
  test registry. No failed assertion was skipped.
- The live Cloudflare dependency/room-lifecycle probe passed before landing:
  create, join, relay, resume, relay after resume, guest leave, host close and
  room removal. It advertised five relay entries, including two secure relay
  entries. This bounded probe did not allocate a TURN game session or claim
  physical distant-network coverage.

Local machine receipts are under
`/private/tmp/cot-wreck-loading-delivery.JiN907/.qa-delivery/`:
`scoped-tests.json`, `scoped-tests.log`, `native/report.json`, and build/type
logs. Temporary artifacts are deliberately not committed.
