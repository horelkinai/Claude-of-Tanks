# Multiplayer response latency — September 2026

Baseline: `b970e9caadb681903b9b35ae1dfecb3650598dfa`, canonical production,
2026-09-05. This is a follow-up to [the multiplayer reliability audit](multiplayer-smoothness-2026-09.md).
The network/room release `10ac577de`, browser warmup follow-ups `6604fbdad` and
`adbcf2aaf`, diagnostic checkpoint `a6394192f`, and acknowledged-ammo follow-up
`c63f136c8` are deployed. The live
verification receipts below distinguish measured improvements from an
unconditional zero-latency claim.

## What is being measured

Native private-room controls create and join a temporary 1v1 room on the actual
deployed website, launch Winter, drive/turn and click the canvas. Two fresh
browser contexts render on the same machine at 1280×800, DPR 1. Each foreground
role is sampled for 20 seconds while its partner remains connected. The probe
does not replace the production endpoint, inject tank state or alter ICE policy.
Here "native controls" means trusted browser keyboard/mouse input, not a
headed-desktop certification: the committed runner launches Puppeteer's headless
Chromium with ANGLE/WebGL enabled. Both contexts share one browser and machine.
Results do not certify another browser/GPU, physical input/display latency or
geographically separated players.

`tools/production-private-room-ui.mjs --url=https://cot.kevinliu.studio --performance`
records application input edge → own firing-event callback → next rAF callback.
These are scheduling measurements, **not** physical click-to-photon or speaker
latency. A callback and a frame being delivered do not establish when a display
or audio device presents them. Only events correlated with one ready local
trigger count; missing and ambiguous receipts remain explicit failures/gaps.
No room codes, player IDs, capabilities, SDP, IP addresses or raw network packets
are written into the report.

Application RTT is the game's smoothed reliable-control PING/PONG timing.
Selected candidate-pair RTT is separately labelled STUN/consent timing; neither
is interchangeable with input-to-feedback delay. The meaning of that candidate
statistic follows the [W3C WebRTC statistics specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc-stats/#dom-rtcicecandidatepairstats-currentroundtriptime).
Likewise [`bufferedAmount`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCDataChannel/bufferedAmount)
only describes the browser's outgoing queued bytes, not total network latency.

## Production baseline

Both peers selected host UDP candidates; this is a same-machine production
frontend/signaling test, not geographically separated players or a TURN gameplay
certificate. Another task's tank-rendering job was paused for the baseline, but
unrelated browser CPU/GPU work was not controlled. Frame tails are recorded,
not used as an uncontended hardware-performance certificate.

| Measurement | Host | Guest |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Ready triggers / confirmed callbacks | 4 / 4 | 4 / 4 |
| Input → firing callback median | 84.8 ms | 53.3 ms |
| Input → firing callback maximum (4 samples) | 103.0 ms | 126.4 ms |
| Authority EVENT arrival → firing callback maximum | Loopback; not an RTC arrival | 84.9 ms |
| Application smoothed RTT p95 | 0 ms | 16.87 ms |
| Visible frame-gap p95 / p99 | 32.9 / 38.4 ms | 30.6 / 35.7 ms |
| Sampled last reconciliation error p95 | 0.3652 m | 0.7186 m |
| Hard snaps / dropped input history | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 |

All eight ready clicks matched, with zero ambiguous shots, page errors or probe
observer failures. Native departure removed the room and closed the browser.
The sampled reconciliation-error distribution is the predictor's diagnostic,
not an external ground-truth path measurement; cumulative correction maxima are
also labelled as cumulative in the machine report, not reset-window maxima.

## Reproduced software delays

The existing 60 Hz simulation publishes snapshots at 20 Hz. Accepted firing
events were waiting for that snapshot boundary, then the own-player event was
waiting for remote interpolation and a one-heavy-effect-per-frame presentation
queue. A deterministic real-client fixture places the own shot last in a
14-shot volley at 2000 ms: receipt is immediate, interpolation eligibility is
2066.67 ms, but own presentation reaches 2283.33 ms. That is **283.33 ms of
software-imposed delay**, independent of actual packet transit.

Remote interpolation remains useful: it trades a bounded amount of delay for
stable movement under uneven snapshot arrival. It should not hold back the
local player's already accepted firing feedback. This distinction follows the
original [snapshot interpolation discussion](https://www.gafferongames.com/post/snapshot_interpolation/);
its example buffer values are not adopted as this game's tuning.

The upload cadence also discarded fractional phase after each send, so a
nominal 60 Hz held input stream became 45 Hz at a 90 Hz display and 48 Hz at
144 Hz. Retaining upload phase separately from actual replay duration avoids
that aliasing without sending catch-up bursts after pauses.

Local movement was being reconciled from a second smoothed/extrapolated pose,
with unacknowledged input replay disabled. Its correction decay was also applied
twice on frames receiving a new snapshot. The replacement is being verified
against the shared zero-network movement model with delayed input/snapshot
delivery, rather than comparing a deliberately leading prediction to the
server's past-time position.

## Local regression receipts (not a production result)

The accepted-shot fixture now flushes a real host's viewer-filtered shot after a
non-snapshot simulation tick. The own client presents it on the first display
frame after receipt, without serializing another snapshot. Other players' hidden
shots remain filtered, and reload, empty and disabled-weapon denials create no
accepted recoil. The local speculative presentation path uses an exact
intent/slot echo; execution tests of the production audio/FX receivers prove no
speculative whizz, crew call, shell ID or prop sweep, and no duplicate confirmed
flash/report. Camera tests cover the same dedup and disposal boundary.
An independent encoded-wire check caught two otherwise easy-to-miss defects:
the compact input codec initially omitted the intent echo, and a late shot plus
same-tick impact could register in reverse order. Both have checked-in regression
coverage. Negotiation keeps 18-column input packets for old hosts; new hosts
advertise the optional, strictly validated 19th intent column. Actual host
loopback, cannon, ATGM, held autocannon, denial and sequence-wrap cases pass.

The shared-model movement A/B fixture drives, turns, brakes and contacts an
obstacle. Error is relative to a present-time zero-network run, not authority's
past-time position:

| Fixture | Old mean trajectory error | Raw authority + replay |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 60 Hz display | 0.772 m | 0.026 m |
| 144 Hz display | 0.775 m | 0.124 m |
| Variable display, 90 ±15 ms each way, 3% input / 5% snapshot loss | 0.982 m | 0.253 m |
| Shared collision model, obstacle contact | 0.214 m | 0.023 m |

Largest backward contact step in that obstacle fixture fell from 0.9996 m to
0.0138 m. These synthetic inputs are reproducible regression receipts, not
claims about every map, connection or player. Predictor coverage passed 100%
lines/functions/branches/statements; bounds and lifecycle tests remain required.

A proposed unilateral 250 ms prediction freeze was **rejected by tests**: the
server's braking tank still coasts, while a downlink-only outage can leave it
driving. Freezing produced 26–33 m correction and a hard snap in a 2-second
blackout fixture. The implemented soft-gap policy instead applies coordinated
neutral/brake after 500 ms of missing advancing authority, both to upload and
the local shared movement model. It cancels pending fire/action intent once,
continues inertial movement and uses the existing reconnect status; a new
authority tick restores controls. The 5-second reconnect watchdog is unchanged.

The actual frame-pump regression combines a 2-second blackout with 90 ±15 ms
each-way delivery and 3% loss at 60/144/variable display rates. In both-way loss,
recovery errors of 8.874/9.053/9.118 m and one hard snap each become
0.363/0.657/0.677 m with no hard snaps or backward steps. Downlink-only remains
snap-free: 0.311/0.359/0.304 m becomes 0.120/0.416/0.248 m. The 144 Hz case has a
0.057 m larger correction, disclosed rather than hidden; authority is safely
braking instead of continuing unseen movement. Physical outages still interrupt
control—this is bounded recovery, not a promise to play through missing data.

Local Cloudflare runtime with real wall-clock timers and live WebSockets removed
an abruptly disconnected host's room after 90,005 ms and a silent-open host's
room after 179,995 ms. A guest kept heartbeating in both cases and did not prolong
the host lease. Both rooms returned `room_not_found` and all owned sockets closed.
This is distinct from the accelerated Workers unit tests; the subsequent
deployed-Worker repetition is recorded in the production release receipt below.

The full suite exposed an explicit-Leave race in the LAN adapter: a native
client sends Leave and immediately starts closing, while an awaited cleanup
check postponed command dispatch. The old open-socket guard discarded the
already-received Leave. The fix admits only that authenticated, current-seat
Leave across the closing transition; closed create/join/relay and retired-seat
commands remain fenced. Fourteen native cleanup cases and the unchanged-deadline
production-readiness fixture pass.

The scoped React Doctor scan reports 83 with one warning: ordered awaited
notification delivery in the signaling adapter. This is a low-frequency room
lifecycle path whose delivery ordering is intentional, not a render-frame task.
It is not comparable to the earlier whole-repository score of 49. Direct code
quality gates for the audio/FX/camera changes pass (399 functions, zero complexity
violations), and actual receiver execution tests pass without requiring a GPU.

The rendered local comparison also passed its unchanged motion, correction,
entry/reset and frame-budget assertions: 1280×720 DPR 1, CPU rate 1, ten seconds
per role, private-room mode, added 90 ±15 ms each way, 5% state and 3% input loss.
This is the committed `multiplayer-render-perf.mjs` development harness, not
production or a like-for-like rendering workload: its solo roster has 14 tanks,
and its network fixture is 2v2. A fleet test used one CPU core concurrently.

| Rendered fixture | Frame-gap p95 | Freezes | Hard snaps | Moving-frame stalls |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Solo | 32.6 ms | 0 | N/A | 31 |
| Private host | 25.3 ms | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Impaired private guest | 17.8 ms | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The guest measured 203.8 ms application RTT, 0 pending outgoing bytes, zero
decode errors and no dropped prediction history. Its largest free reconciliation
error was 0.6224 m and largest correction step 0.08894 m. These results establish
that the impaired peer passed the existing software gates; they do not establish
that multiplayer universally renders faster than single-player.

A separate 14-browser-context, seven-versus-seven WebRTC capacity run passed
balanced roster synchronization, authority handoff, every match handshake and
clean departure under the same impairment parameters. Over eight seconds of
driving plus three seconds of settling, authority advancement averaged 0.384 ms
and peaked at 3 ms, with no dropped catch-up time. This fixture runs real browser
networking and shared simulation without fourteen full Three.js renderers; it
is a capacity/protocol receipt, not a fourteen-rendered-player FPS certificate.

## Limits and release gate

Pre-release validation passed all three repository test segments (88 pre,
365 captured core, 28 post), plus the subsequently registered stale-authority
test and the final changed firing/probe tests. Suite discovery now reports
482 ordered checks. The original core run exposed the Leave race described
above; the repaired core segment was rerun to completion rather than treating
the first red run as green. A redundant second pre-segment run was stopped to
remove owned CPU contention before the repeat production measurement; it is not
counted as another pass. Root and Workers typechecks, public build,
30 Workers tests and the 19-runtime-file quality gate pass (1,072 functions,
zero complexity violations, explicit `any` or `unknown`).

Hits, damage, ammunition, reload and results remain authoritative. Physical
network travel, host CPU stalls and browser suspension cannot be made zero by
presentation code. Packet loss and collisions sometimes require real corrections;
hiding those corrections or weakening authority is not success.
An immediate local flash/report can precede a denial caused by a server-side
change that has not reached the client yet (for example, newly destroyed gun
modules). Readiness freshness and one-intent-per-ready-cycle limits bound this;
they cannot remove that uncertainty without waiting for a round trip. No
speculative hit marker, projectile or ammunition change conceals a denial.

## Production release and repeat measurements

The exact runtime revision above was pushed without force to `origin/main`.
Vercel deployment `dpl_FiVxemPaQhFUw8bqYjeiFxEbBZof` became READY and canonical
`https://cot.kevinliu.studio` reports `v1.0.0+g10ac577de`. The existing Worker
`cot-private-rooms` was deployed as version
`af923039-1119-4465-8854-53237e0ee18a`. No Redis resource, billing plan, TURN
credential, unrelated worktree or environment setting was changed.

Real production abandoned-host rooms expired after 90,032 ms (abruptly closed
socket) and 179,768 ms (silent but open socket). Guests continued heartbeats in
both cases and could not prolong the host lease. Both rooms became unjoinable
with `room_not_found`; all test rooms and sockets were removed. Production
creation, join, bidirectional relay, authenticated resume, guest departure and
host closure passed. A pristine browser obtained 12 actual TURN relay candidates;
this allocation check is separate from the host/host UDP gameplay measurements.

The first post-deployment native-control run repeated the baseline configuration
and matched all eight ready triggers without ambiguity, page errors or observer
failures. Each of the guest's four predicted cues had an exact matching accepted
confirmation with its duplicate effect suppressed. Host loopback was confirmed
before speculation and correctly emitted no speculative duplicate.

| Measurement | Baseline host → new host | Baseline guest → new guest |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| First feedback callback median | 84.8 → 9.5 ms | 53.3 → 3.7 ms |
| First feedback callback maximum (4 samples each) | 103.0 → 31.3 ms | 126.4 → 14.7 ms |
| Input → next rAF median for first feedback | 120.0 → 35.4 ms | 86.7 → 35.0 ms |
| Authority EVENT arrival → confirmed callback maximum | Loopback | 84.9 → 13.8 ms |
| Frame-gap p95 / p99 | 32.9 / 38.4 → 42.2 / 54.9 ms | 30.6 / 35.7 → 30.5 / 32.5 ms |
| Hard snaps / dropped history | 0 / 0 → 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 → 0 / 0 |

The guest's accepted-shot callback still waited for authority (27.3 ms median),
but its local flash/report/recoil did not. The host frame tail regressed in this
run (maximum 155.8 ms versus baseline 122.7 ms); a redundant fleet test occupied
one CPU core. This is retained as an adverse receipt, not discarded or attributed
to a cause without evidence.

After closing that owned CPU test, a second fresh-context run matched all eight
shots with four correct guest prediction confirmations, no hard snaps, no lost
history and no page/observer errors. Host first-feedback median/max were
14.7/23.9 ms; guest 7.3/10.0 ms. Host frame-gap p95/p99/max were
34.6/39.7/127.4 ms; guest 30.9/34.3/36.9 ms. The rare host spike remains close to
the baseline tail and is under trace investigation, not described as zero lag.
Both runs used host/host UDP on one machine; no Internet geography is simulated
by calling a production URL.

Native screenshots were captured outside the timed intervals and inspected:
both contain the actual live Winter battle, tank, HUD and connected diagnostics,
not a loading/blank/menu frame. Room and browser cleanup passed. A bounded
post-release Vercel error-log query returned zero error rows for this deployment;
this is a short observation window, not continuous monitoring.

### First-shot frame investigation

A third fresh production run added bounded, sanitized trace windows around the
four clicks and worst frame. Existing latency/frame distributions were retained,
including intervals crossing sample boundaries; the new diagnostic explicitly
marks such overlap rather than silently filtering it. Only relative times,
numeric resource counters and an allowlist of event names leave the browser.

On `10ac577de`, the host's worst gap was 133.7 ms, entirely inside the sample,
immediately after the first `shell:fired`. Programs increased 326→328,
geometries 575→583 and textures 146→147 during that interval, with a long-task
event and no nearby prop destruction. Later clicks had no program growth.
Host first-feedback median was 14.8 ms, guest prediction median 13.0 ms; all
eight clicks matched, all four guest cues were exact-confirmed/deduplicated,
and both roles had zero hard snaps, dropped history or page/observer errors.
Host frame p95/p99 were 33.6/40.4 ms; guest 30.2/33.5 ms, maximum 44.2 ms.
This distinguishes a first-use graphics stall from a delayed authority response,
but counters alone do not identify the exact two new programs.

Source inspection found missing warm coverage: the network loader submitted a
combined-layer forward render, whereas live transparent combat effects use the
layer-30-only late-effects pass with depth copying and composition. Its empty
shell list also skipped a nonzero tracer draw, and the offscreen fixed-direction
muzzle ring could be view-angle gated or culled. Merely compiling that forward
variant does not submit the actual gameplay pipeline. The global network warm
latch also outlived graphics-resource release on return to Garage. These are
the bounded first-shot warmup defects targeted by the follow-up below; no
unproven terrain or prop-destruction change was made.

The follow-up stages the real muzzle ring and static APFSDS ribbon in the
camera's view immediately before a covered compositor frame. The existing
missile body/flare matrix writer also submits one instance of each missile-only
material without creating a shell, flight trail, event or world sweep. Warmup
repeats on every network entry after Garage resource release. Masks, visibility,
compositor output policy, active render target/face/mip and temporary FX are
restored on failure as well as success. A real-effects regression fails against
the previous source's muzzle visibility and empty missile pools, then passes
with the fix; real guided movement, trail and capacity checks still pass.

### Production warmup follow-up: shells and guided missiles

Follow-up `6604fbdad` was measured on the canonical production frontend in two
fresh native private 1v1 Winter pairs, with the same 20-second-per-role,
1280×800/DPR-1 configuration. Receipts are `production-performance-warm.log`
and `production-performance-missile.log`. The ordinary-shell command remained
unchanged; the second run added `--performance --ammo-slot=2`. Slot selection
uses trusted keyboard input and waits for the selected slot and positive ammo
before timing; it does not alter reloads, ammunition or authority. Both runs
passed native create/join/ready/launch/progression/exit and verified owned-room
cleanup and browser closure. The shell run's screenshots were inspected and
showed the actual live Winter battle.

For ordinary shells, the host frame interval containing the first
`shell:fired` was **34.6 ms**, versus **133.7 ms** in the preceding traced run.
This is a frame-gap measurement, not GPU execution time or input-feedback
latency. Across that first-click window, programs stayed at 337 and textures at
147; geometries still increased 576→583. The seven additional geometries mean
this is not an allocation-free first shot. No long-task event appeared in that
window. All eight shots were authority-confirmed; all four guest predicted
cues were exact-confirmed and deduplicated.

| Ordinary-shell measurement | Host | Guest |
|---|---:|---:|
| Input → first feedback median / maximum | 14.5 / 21.7 ms | 7.1 / 12.7 ms |
| Input → authoritative confirmation median / maximum | 14.5 / 21.7 ms | 31.6 / 38.4 ms |
| Frame gap p95 / p99 / maximum | 30.5 / 34.6 / 48.3 ms | 28.4 / 32.8 / 43.9 ms |
| Hard snaps / dropped history / observer errors | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 / 0 |

The guest's 7.1 ms median is its presentation-only predicted cue, not an early
authoritative shot or damage result. Page errors were also zero.

The guided-missile run likewise had stable program/texture counts in both
first-click windows: host 337/147, guest 302/152. The host's first firing frame
was 22.5 ms. All eight missiles were confirmed, with no unmatched or ambiguous
ready attempts. Three guest cues were predicted and all three were
exact-confirmed/deduplicated. The unpredicted cue was the **second** guest
click, whose trace records `fire` followed by `shell:fired` at +36.7 ms; the
first, third and fourth include `weapon:predicted`. Although all four clicks
passed the probe's reload-ready check, the receipt does not retain the complete
fresh-authority readiness, intent and freshness eligibility state. It cannot
establish why this particular cue used the confirmed path.

| Guided-missile measurement | Host | Guest |
|---|---:|---:|
| Input → authoritative confirmation median / maximum | 9.8 / 17.5 ms | 37.5 / 73.4 ms |
| Input → predicted cue median / maximum | Not used | 14.6 / 20.1 ms (three cues) |
| Frame gap p95 / p99 / maximum | 31.5 / 37.2 / 319.1 ms | 29.1 / 34.3 / 214.2 ms |
| Hard snaps / dropped history / observer errors | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 / 0 |

The missile run is **not hitch-free**: the host had a 319.1 ms gap at sample
time 12.752 s followed by 135.2 ms, and the guest had a 214.2 ms gap at 13.802 s.
The bounded worst-frame windows show no program/texture growth or nearby
allowlisted combat event; these traces do not establish a cause for the later
stalls. Page errors were zero, but that does not invalidate the adverse frame
measurements.

The subsequent source checkpoint `adbcf2aaf` keeps the temporary vehicle-owned
armor scar attached and visible through the actual covered draw, then returns
that same mesh to its pool. Previously it was compiled and detached before
submission. The real-effects regression verifies scene submission and same-pool
reuse, exact transform/visibility restoration after injected stamp, compile and
draw failures with both initial visibility states, and final FX reset even if
scar cleanup throws. Focused tests, typecheck and public build passed.

Fresh production repeats on `adbcf2aaf` retained the same native setup. Ordinary
shells again confirmed all eight attempts, with four exact guest predictions,
zero hard snaps/history drops/page errors, and verified room/browser cleanup.
Host/guest first-feedback medians were 14.3/12.2 ms; frame p95/p99/max were
31.1/35.5/45.6 ms and 30.8/35.3/46.7 ms respectively. Both shell screenshots
were inspected as live connected battles.

The missile repeat confirmed four missiles per player, all four guest cues
exact-predicted/deduplicated. Host first-feedback median was 10.4 ms; guest
predicted median 9.3 ms and accepted median 32.0 ms. Host frame p95/p99/max were
29.7/33.4/46.0 ms; guest 27.2/35.4/224.8 ms. The isolated guest gap at 14.850 s
had no nearby combat or resource growth; the earlier later-stall issue is **not
proven fixed**. Hard snaps/history drops/page errors remained zero and cleanup
passed. The guest screenshot was inspected as a live battle with its four
missiles expended.

That missile receipt includes five locally reload-ready guest clicks but only
four accepted shots: the initial click was unmatched. The probe's historical
readiness flag only checks local reload, not pointer capture or pending ammo
selection. Source and a real input-handler reproduction establish that an
action callback can run for a mouse-capture click without a fire edge; ammo
selection also starts a full reload and can temporarily differ from an older
presented snapshot. Neither explanation is proven for the historical click.
Subsequent diagnostics retain bounded per-click lock/focus, requested/presented
ammo slots, ammo/reload and upload counts without changing the old aggregates.

An opt-in `--performance --cpu-timeline` diagnostic adds bounded numeric
[Chrome runtime counters](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Performance/)
and monotonic alignment with the frame sample. It exports no URLs, peer IDs or
raw protocol payloads. Its overhead makes it a diagnostic, not a replacement
for the uninstrumented performance receipts. A counter interval overlapping a
frame gap does not by itself establish a causal function or GPU problem.

### Native diagnostic checkpoint: pending ammunition is not a lost shot

Canonical production `a6394192f` was READY and inspected on 2026-09-05. Its
browser runtime is unchanged from `adbcf2aaf`. A fresh native missile pair with
the opt-in CPU counters confirmed four missiles per player, four exact guest
predictions/deduplications, zero hard snaps/history drops/page errors, and
verified room/browser cleanup. Both screenshots were inspected as connected
Winter battles. This instrumented run is diagnostic evidence, not a clean
hardware performance certificate.

| Diagnostic measurement | Host | Guest |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Input → first feedback median / max | 5.6 / 25.1 ms | 1.7 / 13.0 ms (predicted) |
| Input → accepted callback median / max | 5.6 / 25.1 ms | 25.4 / 37.8 ms |
| Frame-gap p95 / p99 / max | 31.5 / 35.4 / 46.4 ms | 28.8 / 36.8 / 45.2 ms |
| Locally reload-ready clicks / accepted shots | 4 / 4 | 5 / 4 |

The unmatched guest click at sample +17.7 ms was focused and pointer-locked,
with the mouse firing lane available. It requested slot 1 (four missiles),
while the presented authority still had slot 0 (24 normal shells), reload 0.
The next four clicks, starting at +3063.6 ms after the real switch/load,
matched. This proves a pending-ammunition mismatch for **this** diagnostic;
it does not retroactively establish the cause of any older missing sample.

The optional CPU rows covered the host sample and all but the final 85.4 ms
of the guest sample (one normal polling interval), including both worst frames.
The paired baseline spans were 56.3 ms host and 0.7 ms guest; cross-clock
attribution must respect that uncertainty. The previously observed isolated
214–319 ms stalls did not recur, so this run cannot assign their cause or
prove they are fixed.

The probe setup now waits for requested, presented and last-authoritative
ammunition slots to agree. Its click loop also requires that requested slot
to remain stocked and genuinely reload-ready; automatic fallback shells do
not count as missile shots. This changes future scenario admission only.
Historical aggregate definitions and unmatched click rows remain intact.

### Pending-ammo ownership and HUD follow-up

The diagnostic led to a separate reproducible correctness defect: a rapid
normal-shell → missile → normal-shell cancellation encoded as slots
`0, 1, 0, 1`, because the delayed missile acknowledgment overwrote the latest
normal-shell intent. The actual `BrowserInputRuntime` → `MatchClientRuntime`
→ compact binary codec → bridge regression now stays `0, 1, 0, 0`.

A bounded per-bridge owner retains only the latest selection and the first
successfully uploaded sequence carrying it. A fresh authority acknowledgment
covering that sequence settles the request, including a legitimate denial or
server-selected fallback. Equal slot values alone are not acknowledgment.
Failed uploads, unsent cancellation, stale/null/wrapped ACKs and reconnect are
covered. The slot, reload, ammo and ACK are taken from the same newest own-player
authority tuple; remote-player interpolation is unchanged. Death, new rounds
(normal and background handoff), disposal and new sessions clear the owner.
There is no new protocol field, message cadence, database, client-owned ammo,
or fabricated reload timer.

An actual authoritative countdown fixture found that received inputs are
acknowledged without applying controls, including the transition tick that
first publishes `playing`. Those receipts must not be mistaken for a denied
ammo selection. Only an input successfully sent after the client observes
playing authority can settle the deferred selection.

The HUD highlights the requested stocked card and shows **SWITCHING** until
authority catches up, including an in-flight cancellation to an apparently
matching old slot. It suppresses the old ready pulse, magazine-ready markers
and misleading numeric countdown. The accessible live status is visually
clipped, so it cannot overlap the existing ATGM control or shift mobile layout.
Presentation never mutates combat or input. The helper/aim/HUD focused tests
and 51-viewport layout contracts pass; the network regression tests include
the real encoded-wire and authoritative countdown paths.

The complete release run also exposed a timing-dependent assumption in the
existing simultaneous-tab signaling test. A legitimately retired tab can receive
its raw join response and then lose ownership before the join's async continuation
finishes. Rejecting that call is correct; requiring both competing joins to resolve
was not. The test now requires the winning join to succeed, permits only terminal
retirement errors for the loser, and controls native WebSocket delivery to prove
both before-fulfillment rejection and after-fulfillment retirement. Single-seat
ownership, exactly one retirement notification, no automatic takeover loop and
credential-preserving reopen remain asserted. This is a test-only correction,
not a runtime relaxation. Three complete focused signaling runs and all 14 native
cleanup cases pass; the original full-run failure log is retained.

Release verification completed across all **486 ordered checks**: the initial
`npm test` passed all 88 prechecks and the first 236 core checks, then stopped at
the signaling fixture above. That corrected check passed three complete focused
runs. The remaining 133 core checks and all 28 postchecks passed in order in a
separate continuation. This is complete segmented coverage, **not** a claim that
the original uninterrupted `npm test` was green. The final runtime tree also
passed typecheck, production build, focused ammo/HUD/probe tests and scoped
quality checks (440 functions; no complexity, `any` or `unknown` violations).
Logs remain outside git: `final-ammo-full-test.log`,
`final-ammo-remaining-test.log`, `final-ammo-typecheck-repaired.log` and
`final-ammo-build.log` under the isolated release artifact directory.

These runs selected host/host UDP on the same machine. These are bounded
production-rendering observations, not geographically separated or TURN-path
gameplay measurements, and they do not establish zero network latency,
click-to-photon timing or universally single-player-equivalent performance.

### Final production missile verification

Canonical HTML served `v1.0.0+gc63f136c8`; deployment
`dpl_Hu7YLfzV3Sd1gBULcZAWDJgqeBGh` was READY. The final fresh two-client
Winter run used the same native private-room controls and rendering setup above,
without the optional CPU timeline. The other coordinated browser task was
paused; unrelated machine load remains uncontrolled.

| Final measurement | Host | Guest |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Eligible missile clicks / accepted missiles | 4 / 4 | 4 / 4 |
| Input → first firing feedback median / maximum | 12.2 / 22.2 ms | 9.9 / 16.3 ms (predicted) |
| Input → accepted callback median / maximum | 12.2 / 22.2 ms | 32.2 / 42.4 ms |
| Input → first-feedback next rAF median / maximum | 46.2 / 59.9 ms | 38.4 / 50.2 ms |
| Frame samples | 757 | 832 |
| Frame-gap p95 / p99 / maximum | 35.5 / 39.6 / 45.5 ms | 31.6 / 38.5 / 46.2 ms |
| Sampled last reconciliation error p95 / maximum | 0.4958 / 0.7447 m | 0.4050 / 0.6348 m |
| Cumulative correction-step maximum | 0.1213 m | 0.1001 m |
| Hard snaps / dropped history / observer failures | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 / 0 |

All eight clicks recorded matching requested, presented and last-authority
missile slots, no pending selection, stock and completed reload. No unmatched
or ambiguous eligible clicks occurred. All four guest predictions were matched
and their accepted duplicate effects suppressed; actual projectile creation
and damage remain authoritative. Guest application RTT p95 was 13.0 ms and
receipt-to-accepted-callback maximum was 12.7 ms. Both peers used host/host UDP.
This does not certify distant-client or relay-path gameplay latency.

Both post-sample screenshots were inspected as connected Winter battles with
all four missiles expended and normal ammunition remaining. Native departure
verified room cleanup, the browser closed, and the owned runner exited 0.
There were zero page errors. The raw receipt and screenshots are retained outside
git as `production-ammo-final.log` and `production-ammo-final-images/` under
`/private/tmp/cot-cloudflare-release-r1.eY0t44/`.

The earlier isolated 214–319 ms stalls did not recur in this sample. Their cause
is still unproven; this is not evidence that all such stalls are fixed. The
missile scenario now deliberately excludes unacknowledged/unloaded clicks and
must not be used to erase historical unmatched-click rows. Immediate cosmetic
feedback is also not immediate authoritative impact or physical display timing.

The separate [Colyseus assessment](colyseus-assessment-2026-09.md) explains why
the current Private/LAN architecture is retained, what its newer netcode can
teach this implementation, and what a future dedicated-server comparison would
need to prove. No framework migration was made.

### Follow-up: destruction-history cache evaluated, not shipped

A CPU-only review after `748b120b7` found that each authoritative viewer
snapshot copied the entire cumulative destroyed-obstacle index list, even when
its revision was unchanged. The per-peer ACK histories retained those separate
arrays. A real-authority fixture with 14 players, one successfully
destroyed obstacle and 80 retained snapshots per player produced **1,120
distinct arrays containing the same `[7]`** before the fix. This is not a
browser heap or frame-time measurement.

A candidate published one separate frozen copy per observed destruction
revision. It copied lazily at the next snapshot, not for each obstacle in a
destruction burst. Regression tests proved one retained list instead of 1,120,
with no subsequent unchanged copies. Older snapshots, viewer-specific metadata,
reconnect keyframes, real destruction and new-world/round isolation passed.

At the default 20 Hz and 14 viewers, this would eliminate 280 array copies per second
while the revision is unchanged. For a hypothetical 1,000 destroyed obstacles,
that is 280,000 copied numeric elements per second and up to 1,120,000 retained
numeric elements across 80 snapshots per peer, replaced by one shared
1,000-element list for that revision. These are copy/reference counts, **not**
measured bytes saved or a claimed FPS gain. Serialization still transmits the
list, so no bandwidth or RTT reduction is claimed.

However, the actual codec comparison caught a CPU cost. On Node 24.13 / V8 13.6,
eleven alternating warmed batches encoded fourteen viewer packets per broadcast
(fourteen entities, six shells each), with fresh snapshot metadata. Comparing
the **old per-view slice plus encoding** against the frozen cached list plus
encoding produced byte-identical packets but these broadcast medians:

| Destroyed indices | Old copy + encode | Frozen cache + encode |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0.449 ms | 0.449 ms |
| 1 | 0.434 ms | 0.582 ms |
| 100 | 0.458 ms | 0.615 ms |
| 1,000 | 0.770 ms | 1.406 ms |

Concurrent tests make absolute timings non-isolated. Nevertheless, every paired
nonempty batch was slower with frozen lists. This is a CPU-for-memory tradeoff,
not a demonstrated lag improvement. With no browser GC benefit established,
the candidate was **deferred and removed before release**. The existing authority
copying behavior remains unchanged; an externally mutable shared list was not
substituted to sidestep the cost or weaken snapshot isolation.

The candidate and proof are preserved outside git in the isolated release
artifact directory: `deferred-frozen-destruction-cache.patch`,
`codec-history-broadcast-bench.mjs`, `codec-history-broadcast-receipt.json` and
`codec-frozen-original-receipt.md`.

The same review did not establish a high-leverage client sampling bottleneck.
It did find that absent ERA state allocates a new empty array on every entity
decode: a fourteen-entity interpolated frame plus owned immediate authority
performs 44 such decodes. At 120 Hz, that is 5,280 empty arrays per second.
The complete sampler took approximately 0.022 ms in the initial synthetic
fixture, so this is allocation cleanup, not an explanation for a large stall.
Neither finding establishes the cause or resolution of the earlier isolated
214–319 ms production stalls.

### Client empty-ERA reuse

Only the decoded presentation fallback now shares a frozen empty string list.
The decoded field is typed read-only. Supplied empty or populated source arrays
retain their existing reference semantics; the sampler does not freeze, copy,
or mutate them. The fallback never enters the authoritative capture or wire
representation, so it does not incur the frozen-history serialization cost
above. Interpolation, input cadence, prediction and collision rules are unchanged.

`src/net/snapshotEraReuse.selftest.mjs` exercises the public sampler, including
all 44 decodes in the fourteen-entity/immediate-authority fixture, repeated
sampling, separate buffers, changing depletion, explicit empty and then absent
state, respawn, visibility re-entry and clear. Mutation attempts cannot
contaminate another entity, and real binary packets are byte-identical before
and after sampling. The test is registered in the ordered core suite.

The new fixture failed four of its six cases against the old implementation;
all six pass after the change, as do the existing snapshot and browser-bridge
tests. A separate comparison loaded the actual prepatch and patched samplers,
using fourteen entities, thirty-two frozen raw frames, immediate owned state,
and real empty-list reads. Eleven alternating batches of 4,000 samples yielded
0.006570 ms old versus 0.006321 ms new median per sample (paired median change
−0.000145 ms). This is tiny and noisy under concurrent tests, not an FPS claim
or a like-for-like comparison with the earlier differently instrumented sampler
fixture. The concrete gain is 44 fewer empty-array constructions per frame in
that fourteen-entity scenario, with unchanged decoded values and no observed
serialization tradeoff. Artifacts are `snapshot-era-reuse-bench.mjs`,
`snapshot-era-reuse-benchmark.json`, `snapshot-era-before.ts` and
`snapshot-era-reuse-red.log` in the isolated release artifact directory.

### Empty-ERA release verification

Runtime commit `15b227a2e081164fccdc44747f0e87d4772ab97a` passed the complete
ordered regression run (88 pre, 371 core, 28 post), type checking, the public
production build, the scoped code review and the network complexity gate.
It was fast-forwarded to `origin/main`; Vercel reported the exact SHA ready,
and the canonical website returned HTTP 200 with `v1.0.0+g15b227a2e`.

A fresh native private 1v1 Winter battle then used two browser contexts at
1280×800, DPR 1, with twenty-second foreground samples measured sequentially.
Both selected ordinary ammunition through the existing controls. All eight
eligible clicks produced accepted shots; the guest's four predicted effects
had their accepted duplicates suppressed. Input-edge to effect-callback
medians were 9.6 ms for the host and 11.6 ms for the guest prediction
(maxima 24.9/12.9 ms). Guest authoritative acceptance was 38.6 ms median,
61.1 ms maximum. These callback timings are not click-to-photon measurements:
the corresponding next-rAF callback maxima were 50.6/50.1 ms for the host
effect and guest prediction.

Host/guest frame-gap p95 was 29.8/27.9 ms, p99 42.0/31.2 ms, and maximum
49.9/38.1 ms. Both had zero hard snaps, dropped history, missing snapshot
estimates, observer failures and trace-frame drops. Guest application RTT p95
was 12.0 ms. Both ICE paths were host/host UDP on the same machine; this does
not certify distant clients, TURN relay performance, a larger room, or isolated
GPU performance. No large FPS gain is attributed to the empty-array change.

Both saved screenshots were inspected as live connected battles, with four
ordinary rounds expended per player and the other ammunition retained. Native
departure verified room cleanup, the browser closed, the runner exited 0 and
the shared capture slot was released. Page errors were zero. Evidence remains
outside git in `production-era-reuse.log` and `production-metadata-images/`
under the isolated release artifact directory.

The historical 214–319 ms pauses did not recur in this short sample; their
cause remains unproven. One older gap coincided with falling JS heap usage,
another did not. The existing ±250 ms window around a gap's end can omit the
preceding frame of a longer gap, and its long-task summary does not preserve
the original entry's start/duration. A next diagnostic should retain complete
gap intervals and align bounded Chrome GC/main-thread/compositor activity,
without forcing GC or synchronizing the renderer. A sample that does not
reproduce a pause cannot establish its cause or prove it fixed.
