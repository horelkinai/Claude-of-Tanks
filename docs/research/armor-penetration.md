# Armor & Penetration Mechanics — Implementable Spec

Research target: World of Tanks (PC) armor/penetration model, extended with a modern-tank
layer (composite armor, ERA, APFSDS). Everything below is written to be implemented
directly: formulas, constants, and pseudocode. Angles are in degrees unless noted;
`impactAngle` is measured **from the plate normal** (0° = perpendicular, dead-on hit).

## 0. Scoped penetration feedback contract

Official WoT describes an Armor Flashlight in sniper view: the aimed surface is
classified by the current shell, range and effective armor, with red for low
penetration chance, yellow for moderate, and green for high. The documented PC
implementation has a slight update delay and a 300 m range. Blitz instead uses
red intensity for blocked armor and explicitly excludes external modules/screens
from the colored base surface even though those layers can still stop the shot.

Claude of Tanks uses the same information hierarchy with a continuous
red → amber → green gradient. The source is not a painted texture or nominal
thickness table: every sample calls the same layered `queryAimArmor` and
`estimatePenRatio` path as the reticle, including normalization, ricochet,
distance falloff, ERA state, tracks and spaced armor. It is default-on by user
request, can be disabled in Gameplay → Interface, is restricted to scoped and
spotted live targets, and updates in bounded batches. Like WoT's indicator, it
is guidance rather than a promise: dispersion and penetration/damage rolls still
resolve when the shot is fired.

## 1. Shell types and their flags

| Shell | Normalization | Ricochet at | Pen loss w/ distance | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| AP    | 5°           | ≥ 70°       | moderate (linear with range) | classic kinetic |
| APCR  | 2°           | ≥ 70°       | high (loses pen faster than AP) | fast, subcaliber |
| HEAT  | 0°           | ≥ 85°       | none | chemical jet; killed by spaced armor |
| HE    | 0°           | never       | none | always "does something"; splash |
| APFSDS (modern) | 2° | ≥ 78° (see §11) | very low | long rod; slope-resistant |

Suggested data structure:

```js
const SHELL = {
  AP:     { kind:'KE', normalization: 5, ricochetAngle: 70, distFalloff: 0.05 }, // 5% pen lost per 100 m beyond 100 m (tune)
  APCR:   { kind:'KE', normalization: 2, ricochetAngle: 70, distFalloff: 0.10 },
  HEAT:   { kind:'CE', normalization: 0, ricochetAngle: 85, distFalloff: 0.00 },
  HE:     { kind:'HE', normalization: 0, ricochetAngle: 999, distFalloff: 0.00 },
  APFSDS: { kind:'KE', normalization: 2, ricochetAngle: 78, distFalloff: 0.01, longRod: true },
};
```

WoT models AP/APCR pen falloff per-gun via a `penetration@100m / penetration@500m` pair;
linear interpolation between them, clamped, is exactly what the client does. HE/HEAT lose
zero penetration with distance.

---

## 2. Effective thickness vs impact angle

Line-of-sight (LOS) thickness through a plate:

```
effectiveThickness = nominalThickness / cos(impactAngle)
```

Reference values: 0° → 100%, 30° → 115.5%, 45° → 141.4%, 60° → 200%, 70° → 292.4%.

Implementation: `impactAngle = acos(clamp(dot(-shellDir, plateNormal), 0, 1))`. Compute per
plate the shell ray crosses. Guard the division: cap `impactAngle` at ~89° before dividing
(ricochet checks fire long before that anyway for KE; HE/HEAT hit at any angle).

---

## 3. Normalization

Normalization rotates the shell's *effective* impact angle toward the plate normal before
computing LOS thickness:

```
effectiveAngle = max(0, impactAngle - normalization)
effectiveThickness = nominalThickness / cos(radians(effectiveAngle))
```

Constants (WoT since 8.6): **AP = 5°, APCR = 2°, HEAT = 0°, HE = 0°.**
Normalization is applied **after** the ricochet check (a 71° AP hit ricochets; it does not
get normalized down to 66° first).

---

## 4. Ricochet

Checked first, against the **raw** impact angle:

- **AP / APCR:** ricochet if `impactAngle > 70°` — regardless of penetration value.
- **HEAT:** ricochet ("no detonation") if `impactAngle > 85°` (since 0.8.9).
- **HE:** never ricochets; it detonates on the surface no matter the angle.
- Ricochet is suppressed by 3× overmatch (see §5).
- A ricocheted AP/APCR shell continues flying with **full penetration retained** (WoT ≥9.14
  keeps full pen; earlier builds used 75% — pick full pen) and may strike another plate or
  vehicle. HEAT ricochet just deflects once, then despawns. External modules other than
  the gun never cause ricochet.

```js
function ricochets(shell, impactAngleDeg, caliber, plateNominal) {
  if (shell.type === 'HE') return false;
  if (caliber >= 3 * plateNominal) return false;         // 3x overmatch: never ricochet
  return impactAngleDeg > SHELL[shell.type].ricochetAngle;
}
```

---

## 5. Overmatch (caliber vs plate thickness) — AP/APCR only

Let `C = shellCaliber (mm)`, `T = plate nominal thickness (mm)`.

- **C ≥ 3T ("3-caliber rule"):** ricochet is impossible at any angle. Shell still must
  penetrate the (angled) effective thickness — overmatch doesn't grant free penetration,
  but with C ≥ 3T the boosted normalization below usually makes it trivial.
- **C ≥ 2T ("2-caliber rule"):** normalization is amplified:

```
normalization' = normalizationBase * 1.4 * C / T
```

Example: 122 mm AP (base 5°) vs 40 mm plate → 5 × 1.4 × 122/40 = 21.35° normalization.
Apply the amplified normalization in the §3 formula. HEAT and HE get no overmatch
(modern HE in WoT 1.13+ has its own 3T-caliber/2T-pen overmatch; for the game, keep HE
simple — see §8).

---

## 6. Penetration and damage RNG (±25%)

Both the shell's listed penetration and listed damage are **uniformly** randomized ±25%
per shot (community consensus: uniform, possibly center-weighted; uniform is fine):

```js
const roll = (avg) => avg * (0.75 + Math.random() * 0.5);   // U[0.75, 1.25]

penetrationRoll = roll(shell.penetrationAtRange(distance));
damageRoll      = roll(shell.avgDamage);
```

The pen roll is made **once per shot** and compared to the summed effective thickness of
everything the shell must pass through. Decision: `penetrates = penetrationRoll >= totalEffectiveThickness`.
On non-penetration, KE/HEAT shells deal **zero** hull damage (HE differs, §8).

---

## 7. Spaced armor, screens, tracks

Spaced armor (side skirts, gun mantlet outer layer, tracks acting as a screen, turret
stowage bins) is a separate plate with an air gap before main armor.

Rules:
- The shell resolves ricochet + normalization **independently at each layer**. A shell may
  ricochet off a screen; the deflected ray is re-traced.
- KE (AP/APCR): subtract the screen's effective thickness from the pen roll, then continue
  the ray to the main armor: `remainingPen = penetrationRoll - screenEffectiveThickness`.
- **HEAT vs spaced armor (the key interaction):** the jet forms at the *first* surface hit.
  After piercing the screen, HEAT loses **5% of its penetration per 10 cm of air-gap
  travel** before reaching main armor:

```js
remainingPen = (penRoll - screenEffectiveThickness) * (1 - 0.05 * (gapMeters / 0.10));
// clamp at 0. gapMeters measured along the shell ray between layers.
```
- HE detonates on the first surface it touches (screen counts), so spaced armor absorbs
  HE splash almost completely (splash then attenuates through the main plate, §8).
- Tracks: treat as a spaced plate of `trackArmor` mm (typ. 15–40 mm) covering the hull side
  lower area; a hit always damages the track module (§9) *and* continues as a screen hit.
- After a full penetration, let the shell ray continue for **10× caliber** distance inside
  the tank to collect module/crew hits; a KE shell can even exit and hit a second vehicle
  with `remainingPen`.

---

## 8. HE mechanics

Use the classic (pre-1.13) model — it's self-consistent and easy to implement:

1. Roll pen as usual. If `penRoll >= effectiveThickness` at the impact point (HE has no
   normalization; ratio uses LOS thickness), it's a **full penetration**: full `damageRoll`
   plus internal blast module/crew checks along a cone.
2. Otherwise the shell explodes on the armor surface. Damage at the point of impact /
   to splashed targets:

```
splashDamage = 0.5 * damageRoll * (1 - dist / splashRadius) - 1.1 * (nominalArmor + spallLiner)
splashDamage = max(0, splashDamage)
```

   - `dist` = distance from detonation point to the impacted plate (0 for direct hits).
   - `nominalArmor` = thickness of the plate facing the blast **at the thinnest point the
     blast can reach** (WoT searches for the weakest reachable plate within the sphere;
     acceptable simplification: use the hit plate).
   - `splashRadius` scales with caliber, e.g. `radius_m ≈ 0.4 * caliber_mm / 25` (105 mm ≈ 1.7 m,
     152 mm ≈ 2.4 m; tune to taste).
3. HE always runs module/crew splash checks even without hull damage (crew chance is
   lower, §9), which is why HE "resets caps" and breaks tracks reliably.

---

## 9. Hitboxes, module damage, saving throws

### Armor zones
Model each tank as a set of convex collision plates grouped into zones, each with nominal
thickness: hull front upper/lower glacis, hull sides, hull rear, hull roof/belly (thin — 
overmatch bait), turret front, mantlet (often 2 layers = spaced), turret sides/rear/roof,
cupola (weakspot), MG port / driver's hatch weakspots. Internal volume contains module
and crew hitboxes (ellipsoids, capsules, and elliptic cylinders) placed where the
first-party procedural geometry and authored systems layout agree:
engine+fuel rear, transmission front (German tanks: front fires), ammo rack in turret
bustle and/or hull front sides, driver front-left, etc.

### Module HP and saving throws
Each module has its own HP pool, independent of hull HP. When the shell ray intersects a
module hitbox (after penetrating armor, or as splash), first roll the **saving throw** —
the chance the module takes damage at all:

| Module              | Chance to be damaged when hit |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Tracks              | 100% |
| Engine              | 45% |
| Fuel tank           | 45% |
| Observation device  | 45% |
| Turret ring         | 45% |
| Radio               | 45% |
| Gun                 | 33% |
| Ammo rack           | 27% |
| Crew member (AP/APCR/HEAT) | 33% |
| Crew member (HE splash)    | 10% |

If the save fails (module IS hit), apply module damage. WoT uses a hidden per-shell
`moduleDamage` value (~roughly proportional to caliber) with ±25% RNG. Implementable
default: `moduleDamage = shell.caliber * 1.0 ± 25%` and module HP pools like:

| Module | HP (baseline, scale by tier) |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Track  | 100 (repairs to 50 "yellow" automatically) |
| Engine | 160 |
| Fuel tank | 120 |
| Ammo rack | 150 |
| Gun    | 150 |
| Radio  | 90 |
| Observation device | 80 |
| Turret ring | 120 |

States: **> 50% HP = healthy**, **≤ 50% = damaged (yellow)** with a debuff, **0 = destroyed
(red)**. Crew auto-repairs a red module back to yellow (50%) over `repairTime` seconds;
consumable repair restores to 100%.

Yellow/red effects:
- **Tracks:** red = immobilized until repaired. (Damaging a track absorbs the shell's hull
  damage unless the ray also passes into the hull — tracks are both a module and a screen.)
- **Engine:** yellow = −50% engine power; red = immobile. Every damaging hit to the engine
  rolls the engine's **fire chance** (§10).
- **Fuel tank:** no debuff while yellow; **red = guaranteed fire (100%)**.
- **Ammo rack:** yellow = +50% reload time; **red = ammo detonation → vehicle instantly
  destroyed** regardless of remaining HP (skip if rack HP buffed and empty racks optional).
- **Gun:** yellow = worse accuracy/no aim shrink; red = cannot fire until repaired.
- **Radio:** reduced signal/minimap share range.
- **Observation device (viewport):** −50% view range while damaged.
- **Turret ring:** slower/locked traverse.

### Crew
Crew members (commander, gunner, driver, loader, radioman) are binary: healthy or knocked
out. Knocked out = that crewman's function degrades (gunner → slow aim, driver → slow
tank, loader → slow reload, commander → view range & loss of bonuses). First-aid
consumable revives. If **all** crew are knocked out, vehicle is dead. Injury chance uses
the table above per hit ray intersection.

---

## 10. Fire

- Trigger sources: any damaging hit to the **engine** rolls `engineFireChance`
  (per-engine constant, typically **10–20%**, some engines 40%); a **destroyed fuel tank**
  ignites with **100%** chance; transmission hits count as engine hits (front-mounted
  transmission = frontal fires).
- While burning: tick every **0.5 s**. Per tick: hull damage ≈ **0.5% of max HP** plus
  module damage to engine/fuel/ammo (small fixed amount, e.g. 10 module HP per tick).
- Duration: base burn ~8–12 ticks with each tick rolling an extinguish chance
  (fire "dies down"); firefighting skill raises the per-tick self-extinguish probability;
  manual extinguisher ends it immediately; automatic extinguisher triggers on ignition
  after ~0.5 s.

```js
onFireTick(tank) {
  tank.hp -= 0.005 * tank.maxHp;
  for (m of [engine, fuelTank, ammoRack]) m.hp -= 10;
  if (rand() < tank.extinguishChancePerTick) tank.fire = false;
}
```

## 11. Modern extension — composite armor, ERA, APFSDS

### 11.1 Composite armor: dual RHAe ratings

Real composites (Chobham, combination-K) resist shaped-charge jets far better than steel
of equal mass, and kinetic rods somewhat better. Model every modern plate with **two
effective thickness numbers** instead of one:

```js
plate = { thicknessKE: 600, thicknessCE: 900, nominalForOvermatch: 250 /* physical mm */ };
```

- KE shells (AP/APCR/APFSDS) test against `thicknessKE / cos(effAngle)`.
- CE shells (HEAT, ATGM) test against `thicknessCE / cos(effAngle)`.
- Overmatch/ricochet geometry uses the **physical** plate thickness (`nominalForOvermatch`),
  not the RHAe rating — a 3BM60 rod doesn't ricochet off a roof because the roof has
  fancy RHAe.
- Typical ratios for flavor: steel 1.0/1.0; composite ~1.2–1.5 KE, 2.0–3.0 CE per physical mm.

### 11.2 ERA (explosive reactive armor)

ERA is a consumable spaced layer: each ERA tile is a small hitbox that **detonates once**
then is gone (visibly removed from the model). Real-world anchors: Kontakt-1 cuts single
HEAT jets 50–80%; Kontakt-5 ≈ 600 mm CE and 200–250 mm KE RHAe, ~20% APFSDS pen cut;
Relikt claims >50% vs rods; tandem warheads defeat single-layer ERA (precursor charge
pops the tile, main jet hits bare armor).

Game abstraction per tile:

```js
era = { keReduction: 0.20,   // fraction of remaining pen removed from long rods
        ceFlat: 400,         // flat mm subtracted from HEAT pen (heavy ERA)
        spent: false };

function applyERA(shell, pen) {
  if (era.spent) return pen;
  era.spent = true;                        // tile detonates either way
  if (shell.tandem) return pen;            // precursor eats the tile, main charge unaffected
  if (shell.kind === 'CE') return max(0, pen - era.ceFlat);
  if (shell.kind === 'KE') return pen * (1 - era.keReduction);
  return pen;                              // HE: tile detonates, adds its thickness to splash armor
}
```

Light ERA (Kontakt-1 class): `ceFlat` 300–500, `keReduction` 0. Heavy ERA (Kontakt-5/Relikt
class): `ceFlat` 500–700, `keReduction` 0.15–0.5. HE detonating on ERA just pops tiles.

### 11.3 Why long-rod APFSDS ignores slope (and the abstraction)

Physically: a long rod (L/D 20–30) hitting an oblique plate doesn't behave like a solid
shot. The tip erodes and the rod "turns into" the plate; sloped armor only offers roughly
its **line-of-sight** thickness, not the multiplied protection older AP saw
([Sloped armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloped_armour)). Pre-APFSDS rounds lost
extra energy to deflection ("sliding"), so slope > LOS; rods collapse that bonus back to
plain LOS, and very high obliquity thin plates can even *underperform* LOS against rods.

Clean game abstraction — **slope efficiency exponent** per shell kind:

```
effectiveThickness = thickness_vs_kind / cos(effAngle) ^ slopeExponent
   AP/APCR: slopeExponent = 1.4   (slope worth MORE than LOS — rewards angling classics)
   APFSDS:  slopeExponent = 1.0   (pure LOS — slope barely helps)
   HEAT:    slopeExponent = 1.0   (jets also just see LOS)
```

(If WW2-era plates should behave classically with exponent 1.0 for everything, instead give
APFSDS a *ricochet* advantage only: ricochetAngle 78° and normalization that scales with
angle, `norm = 2° + 0.08 * impactAngle`. Either abstraction works; the exponent is simpler
and reads clearly in a damage-log UI.)

APFSDS also overmatches aggressively: use `C = rodDiameter * 3` as the effective caliber
for the §5 rules so thin roofs/skirts never bounce rods.

## 12. Consolidated resolution algorithm

`rollModuleDamage` = saving-throw table (§9) → subtract `moduleDamage ±25%` → apply
yellow/red effects → engine/fuel fire rolls (§10). Deterministic order matters for
replays: consume RNG in fixed sequence (pen, dmg, then per-intersection module rolls).
