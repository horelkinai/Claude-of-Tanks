# Internal-Module System

The engine/ammo-rack/fuel/track/crew damage layer: where module hitboxes come
from, how hits resolve into module damage, the one state machine that owns
module states, and the balance tables. Consolidated in the module_hitbox r1
pass (2026-07-31); sources of record are listed per section.

## Architecture — one source of truth per concern

| Concern | Owner | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Closed armor cells / smooth module and crew volumes | `spec.armor` (authored zones finalized by `vehicles/combatAnatomy.ts`) | `sim/armor.ts` `traceTank`, Gallery diagnostics, scoped armor flashlight |
| Hit resolution (saves, damage, fire, detonation) | `src/sim/damage.ts` | `game/state.ts` stepShells |
| Module state machine (`ok`/`yellow`/`red`, repairs) | `src/sim/damage.ts` (`refreshModuleState`, `tickModuleRepairs`, `repairAllModules`) | state.ts game loop, main.ts repair-kit consumable |
| State broadcasts | `module:state` bus event `{ id, module, state, repaired? }` emitted by `game/state.ts` only | audio.ts, hud.ts alerts, (killcam/damage panel read CombatState directly) |
| Presentation (labels, colors, order) | `src/ui/moduleRegistry.ts` | hud.ts, damagePanel.ts, shotInfo.ts, killcam.ts |

The `repaired: true` payload flag marks a red→yellow RECOVERY so the HUD
toasts `<MODULE> REPAIRED` instead of `DAMAGED`; audio infers direction from
its own prev-state tracker and ignores the flag.

## Hit pipeline (sim/damage.ts `resolveShellHit`)

Ordered `traceTank` intersections: ricochet on raw angle → ERA tiles → spaced
screens (HEAT gap decay) → main-armor pen check → post-pen fragment sweep
rolling module/crew volumes. Two rules matter for module correctness:

- **Straddling-volume flush** (module_hitbox r1): volumes are reported once at
  their entry `t` with their exit stamped as `tExit`. A volume entered BEFORE
  the penetrated plate whose span extends past it (Tiger sponson rack hugging
  the hull side, Merkava front engine wrapping past the glacis) is parked and
  rolled AT the pen, in trace order. Before this rule those modules could
  never be damaged from their natural attack bearing (8 Merkava engines,
  Tiger rack, Leclerc fuel — measured by the probe below).
- **Post-pen limit**: module/crew volumes further than
  `max(1.25 m, 10 × caliber)` from the entry point do not roll (the penetrator
  and fragment corridor dissipates). The floor keeps penetrating autocannon
  rounds mechanically capable of reaching central modules; full-caliber tank
  guns retain their caliber-scaled reach. Straddlers begin AT the pen point,
  so the limit cannot exclude them.

## Balance tables (source of record: `src/sim/damage.ts`)

Module HP (`MODULE_HP`, ×2.5 on `era: 'modern'` specs):

| Module | HP (WW2) | HP (modern) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| trackL / trackR | 100 | 250 |
| engine | 160 | 400 |
| fuelTank | 120 | 300 |
| ammoRack | 150 | 375 |
| gun | 150 | 375 |
| turretRing | 120 | 300 |
| gunMount | 120 | 300 |
| autoloader | 125 | 312.5 |
| feedSystem | 110 | 275 |
| missileRack | 120 | 300 |
| transmission | 140 | 350 |
| radio | 90 | 225 |
| optics | 80 | 200 |

Damage rolls (`damageChance` — chance the module takes damage when its volume is
crossed; per-hit module damage is `moduleDmg ≈ caliberMm` ±25%):

| Module | Chance |
| --- | --- |
| tracks | 1.00 |
| engine / fuelTank / optics / turretRing / radio | 0.45 |
| transmission / gunMount | 0.45 |
| feedSystem | 0.38 |
| autoloader | 0.36 |
| gun | 0.33 |
| missileRack | 0.30 |
| ammoRack | 0.27 |

Fire and consequence rules: engine and transmission ignite at 15% per damaging hit (safety
fuel tank equipment halves it); a fuel tank NEVER burns while yellow and
ignites at 100% on red; ammo rack red = detonation (hp→0, turret toss). Fires
tick every 0.5 s: 0.5% max HP + 10 HP off engine/fuel/ammo, 12%
self-extinguish per tick (auto-extinguisher doubles it), 10-tick budget
(extinguisher halves it, floor 2).

State machine: hp > 50% `ok`; ≤ 50% `yellow`; 0 `red`. Red modules auto-repair
to yellow (50% HP) after `REPAIR_S = 10 s` — count-up accumulator, toolbox
equipment ×1.25 rate. Debuffs: yellow gun σ×2, red gun cannot fire, yellow/red
ammo rack ×1.5 reload, dead loader ×1.5 reload (multiplicative), red tracks
immobilize (movement.ts), red engine caps drive power, optics/radio degrade
spotting (spotting.ts); a yellow gun mount applies the same accuracy penalty
as a damaged gun and a red gun mount prevents its casemate weapon from firing.

## Combat anatomy — where collision and internal volumes come from

- **Closed external shell**: `tools/gen-combat-anatomy.mjs` clips the actual
  first-party procedural hull/turret armor triangles into longitudinal slabs,
  constructs bounded convex cells, and records exact cupola/hatch cells. The
  fleet finalizer maps every generated face back to the nearest canonical armor
  zone, preserving physical/KE/CE thickness and layered ERA/spaced/track rules.
- **Smooth internals**: authored `min`/`max` records remain stable calibration
  envelopes, not ray-test AABBs. At finalization they become ellipsoids,
  capsules, or elliptic cylinders. Long volumes are segmented across adjacent
  shell cells and seated inside their convex component, eliminating false AABB
  corner hits and internal volumes exposed through empty air.
- **Hand-authored layouts**: foundational and modern vehicles still own the
  semantic location and articulation frame (`turretLocal`) of each system;
  the finalizer changes collision representation, not module identity.
- **Parametric expansion template**: additional first-party vehicles
  (`communityArmor` is the retained helper name in specs.ts and its userdrops
  mirror) derive every box from `spec.dims` —
  rear-half engine, mid fuel, center-forward ammo, ring band at the roof.
- **Donor copies re-fitted to dims** (module_hitbox r1): derived variants
  (`additionalFleetSpecs.ts` and `classicFleetSpecs.ts`) copy a donor spec and
  patch `dims`; the armor is
  now refit through `fitArmorToDims(armor, donorDims, dims)` (specs.ts) —
  per-axis affine scale of plates/authoring bounds/pivots/barrel. Before the fit the
  m60a1 carried Leopard-1-sized armor 1.2 m shorter and 0.23 m narrower than
  its rendered hull: shots at the rendered turret resolved as air. The
  geometry gate pins visuals to `spec.dims`, so dims are the shared truth for
  both visual and armor envelope.
- Published `heightM` may include external sights, weapons and antennas. Those
  are never allowed to stretch the base shell; structural cupolas and hatches
  receive their own exact convex cells, while equipment remains external.

## Probes / gates

- `node src/vehicles/combatAnatomy.selftest.mjs` — fleet-wide generated-data
  gate: all 123 playable tanks, exact roof structures, supported smooth shapes,
  internal-shape containment, and deterministic front/side/top seam rays.
- `node tools/module-hit-probe.mjs` — legacy targeted pure-sim probe (all roster
  ~2 s). Structural containment, scripted mega-pen shots through every
  internal module volume from its own side / long axis / top (the right module
  must ROLL, not merely be traced), track reachability via moduleLink, and
  the armor-envelope vs dims drift audit. Exit 1 on any hard FAIL.
  - The historical r1 pass corrected ten failures. The current fleet result is
    **80/80 pass**; published-height drift remains warning-only for appendages
    that intentionally sit above the armored envelope.
- `node tools/module-crit-probe.mjs [--shots N --seed S]` — seeded realistic
  volley through the live pipeline; asserts crits-given-pen inside 15–90%.
  Reference @400 shots/seed 4242: pen 51%, crit-given-pen 72%, crit share
  tracks 65%, engine 8%, gun/optics/fuel ~6% each, ammoRack 3.6%,
  ring/radio ~3%; 22 crew hits, 9 fires.
- `node tools/module-visual-align-probe.mjs [--ids=…]` — browser scan of the
  BUILT visual (rig-classified vertices) vs armor model: deck/side/track/ring
  gaps. Audit aid, exit 0; deck metric unreliable on some GLB rigs with
  follower-swept subtrees (casemates report ring n/a-ish values).

## Presentation contracts

- Scoped armor flashlight (`game/armorAimOverlay.ts`): default-on, optional in
  Gameplay → Interface, and visible only in the gunner scope on an already
  spotted live target. It renders the same closed collision faces used by
  combat and colors them continuously red → amber → green by the selected
  shell's real layered penetration estimate (distance, angle, normalization,
  ricochet, ERA, tracks and spaced armor included). Sampling is spread across
  48-face frame batches to avoid periodic render stalls; battle exit disposes
  every generated buffer.
- Damage panel (`ui/damagePanel.ts`): reads CombatState directly per frame;
  exact module and crew volume centers project through their authored hull or
  turret frame before a tightly source-bounded screen-space collision pass.
  The canvas schematic repaints only when the dirty signature (module/crew
  states + quantized hull/turret bearing) changes. Colors and role vocabulary
  come from `ui/moduleRegistry.ts`.
- Kill cam x-ray and shot cards label modules via the same registry
  (`MODULE_LABEL`, `CREW_LABEL` — killcam/shotInfo copies had drifted:
  'Fuel' vs 'Fuel Tank').
- HUD toasts: `moduleAlertLabel()` (tracks collapse to `TRACK`), plus the
  `REPAIRED` recovery toast described above.
